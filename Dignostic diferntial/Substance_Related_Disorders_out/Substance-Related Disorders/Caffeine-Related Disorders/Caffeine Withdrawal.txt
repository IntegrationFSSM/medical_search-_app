Differential Diagnosis
 Other medical conditions and medication side effects.
 Caffeine withdrawal can mimic migraine and
 other headache disorders, viral illnesses, sinus conditions, tension, other drug withdrawal states
 (e.g., from amphetamines, cocaine), and medication side effects. The final determination of
 caffeine withdrawal should rest on a determination of the pattern and amount consumed, the time
 interval between caffeine abstinence and onset of symptoms, and the particular clinical features
 presented by the individual. A challenge dose of caffeine followed by symptom remission may
 be used to confirm the diagnosis.
 Caffeine-induced sleep disorder.
 Caffeine withdrawal is distinguished from caffeine-induced sleep
 disorder (e.g., caffeine-induced sleep disorder, insomnia type, with onset during withdrawal)
 because the sleep symptoms are in excess of those usually associated caffeine withdrawal,
 predominate in the clinical presentation, and are severe enough to warrant clinical attention.
