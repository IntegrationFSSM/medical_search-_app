Differential Diagnosis
 Independent mental disorders.
 Caffeine intoxication may be characterized by symptoms (e.g.,
 panic attacks) that resemble independent mental disorders. To meet criteria for caffeine
 intoxication, the symptoms must not be associated with another medical condition or another
 mental disorder, such as an anxiety disorder, that could better explain them. Manic episodes;
 panic disorder; generalized anxiety disorder; amphetamine intoxication; sedative, hypnotic, or
 anxiolytic withdrawal or tobacco withdrawal; sleep disorders; and medication-induced side
 effects (e.g., akathisia) can cause a clinical picture that is similar to that of caffeine intoxication.
Caffeine-induced mental disorders.

 The temporal relationship of the symptoms to increased
 caffeine use or to abstinence from caffeine helps to establish the diagnosis. Caffeine intoxication
 is differentiated from caffeine-induced anxiety disorder, with onset during intoxication (see
 “Substance/Medication-Induced Anxiety Disorder” in the chapter “Anxiety Disorders”), and
 caffeine-induced sleep disorder, with onset during intoxication (see “Substance/Medication
Induced Sleep Disorder” in the chapter “Sleep-Wake Disorders”), because the symptoms (e.g.,
 anxiety and insomnia, respectively) in these latter disorders are in excess of those usually
 associated with caffeine intoxication, predominate in the clinical presentation, and are severe
 enough to warrant independent clinical attention.
