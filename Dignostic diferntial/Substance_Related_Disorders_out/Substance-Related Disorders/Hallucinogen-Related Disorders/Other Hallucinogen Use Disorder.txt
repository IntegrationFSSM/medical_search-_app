Differential Diagnosis
 Other substance disorders. The effects of hallucinogen use must be distinguished from those of
 other substances (e.g., amphetamine use disorder, alcohol or sedative withdrawal), especially
 because contamination of the hallucinogens with other drugs is relatively common.
  Hallucinogen intoxication and hallucinogen-induced mental disorders. Hallucinogen use disorder is
 differentiated from hallucinogen intoxication and hallucinogen-induced mental disorders (e.g.,
 hallucinogen-induced psychotic disorder) in that hallucinogen use disorder describes a
 problematic pattern of hallucinogen use that involves impaired control over hallucinogen use,
 social impairment attributable to hallucinogen use, risky hallucinogen use (e.g., driving while
 intoxicated), and pharmacological symptoms (the development of tolerance), whereas
 hallucinogen intoxication and hallucinogen-induced mental disorders describe psychiatric
 syndromes that occur in the context of heavy use. Hallucinogen intoxication and hallucinogen
induced mental disorders occur frequently in individuals with hallucinogen use disorder. In such
 cases, a diagnosis of hallucinogen intoxication or a hallucinogen-induced mental disorder should
 be given in addition to a diagnosis of hallucinogen use disorder, the presence of which is
 indicated in the diagnostic code.
 Independent mental disorders. Some of the effects of hallucinogen use may resemble symptoms of
 independent psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia and depressive and bipolar disorders.
 Discerning whether symptoms occurred before the intake of the drug is important in the
 differentiation of acute drug effects from a preexisting mental disorder. In particular,
 schizophrenia should be ruled out, as some affected individuals (e.g., individuals with
 schizophrenia who exhibit paranoia) may falsely attribute their symptoms to use of
 hallucinogens.
