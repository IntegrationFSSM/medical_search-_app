Differential Diagnosis
 In particular, in the absence of intact reality testing (i.e., without insight that the perceptual
 abnormalities are drug induced), an additional diagnosis of phencyclidine-induced psychotic
 disorder should be considered.
 Other substance intoxication.
 Phencyclidine intoxication should be differentiated from intoxication
 due to other substances, including other hallucinogens; amphetamine, cocaine, or other
 stimulants; and anticholinergics, as well as withdrawal from benzodiazepines. Nystagmus and
 bizarre and violent behavior may distinguish intoxication due to phencyclidine from that due to
 other substances. Toxicological tests may be useful in making this distinction. However, the
 weak correlation between quantitative toxicology levels of phencyclidine and clinical
 presentation may diminish the utility of the laboratory findings for patient management.
 Phencyclidine-induced mental disorders.
 Phencyclidine 
intoxication 
is 
distinguished 
from
 phencyclidine-induced mental disorders (e.g., phencyclidine-induced depressive disorder, with
 onset during intoxication) because the symptoms (e.g., depressed mood) in the latter disorders
 are in excess of those usually associated with phencyclidine intoxication, predominate in the
 clinical presentation, and are severe enough to warrant clinical attention.
 Other medical conditions.
 Medical conditions to be considered include certain metabolic disorders
 like hypoglycemia and hyponatremia, central nervous system tumors, seizure disorders, sepsis,
 neuroleptic malignant syndrome, and vascular insults.
