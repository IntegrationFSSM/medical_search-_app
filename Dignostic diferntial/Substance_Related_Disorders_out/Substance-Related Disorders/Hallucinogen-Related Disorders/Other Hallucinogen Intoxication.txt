Differential Diagnosis
 Other substance intoxication.
 598
 Other hallucinogen intoxication should be differentiated from
 intoxication with amphetamine-type substances, cocaine, or other stimulants; anticholinergics,
 inhalants, and phencyclidine. Toxicological tests are useful in making this distinction, and
 determining the route of administration may also be useful.
 Other conditions.
 Other disorders and conditions to be considered include schizophrenia,
 depression, withdrawal from other drugs (e.g., sedatives, alcohol), certain metabolic disorders
 (e.g., hypoglycemia), seizure disorders, tumors of the central nervous system, and vascular
 insults.
 Hallucinogen persisting perception disorder.
 Other hallucinogen intoxication is distinguished from
Hallucinogen-induced mental disorders.
 hallucinogen persisting perception disorder because the symptoms in the latter continue
 episodically or continuously for weeks (or longer) after the most recent intoxication.
 Other hallucinogen intoxication is distinguished from
 hallucinogen-induced mental disorders (e.g., hallucinogen-induced anxiety disorder, with onset
 during intoxication) because the symptoms (e.g., anxiety) in these latter disorders are in excess
 of those usually associated with other hallucinogen intoxication, predominate in the clinical
 presentation, and are severe enough to warrant independent clinical attention.
