Differential Diagnosis
Conditions to be ruled out include schizophrenia, other drug effects, neurodegenerative
 disorders, stroke, brain tumors, infections, and head trauma. Neuroimaging results in
 hallucinogen persisting perception disorder cases are typically negative. As noted earlier, reality
 testing remains intact (i.e., the individual is aware that the disturbance is linked to the
 600
 effect of the drug); if this is not the case, another disorder (e.g., psychotic disorder, another
 medical condition) might better explain the abnormal perceptions.
