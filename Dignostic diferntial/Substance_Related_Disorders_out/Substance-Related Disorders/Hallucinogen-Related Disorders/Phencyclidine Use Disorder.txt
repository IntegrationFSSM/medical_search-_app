Differential Diagnosis
 Other substance use disorders.
 Distinguishing the effects of phencyclidine from those of other
 substances may be important, because phencyclidine can be an additive to other substances (e.g.,
 cannabis, cocaine).
 Phencyclidine intoxication and phencyclidine-induced mental disorders.
 Phencyclidine use disorder is
 differentiated from phencyclidine intoxication and phencyclidine-induced mental disorders (e.g.,
 phencyclidine-induced psychotic disorder) in that phencyclidine use disorder describes a
 problematic pattern of phencyclidine use that involves impaired control over phencyclidine use,
 social impairment attributable to phencyclidine use, risky phencyclidine use (e.g., driving while
 intoxicated), and pharmacological symptoms (the development of tolerance), whereas
Independent mental disorders.
 phencyclidine intoxication and phencyclidine-induced mental disorders describe psychiatric
 syndromes that occur in the context of heavy use. Phencyclidine intoxication and phencyclidine
induced mental disorders occur frequently in individuals with phencyclidine use disorder. In
 such cases, a diagnosis of phencyclidine intoxication or a phencyclidine-induced mental disorder
 should be given in addition to a diagnosis of phencyclidine use disorder, the presence of which is
 indicated in the diagnostic code.
 Some of the effects of phencyclidine use may resemble symptoms
 of independent mental disorders, such as psychosis (schizophrenia); low mood (major depressive
 disorder); and violent, aggressive behaviors (conduct disorder, antisocial personality disorder).
 Discerning whether these behaviors occurred before the intake of the drug is important in the
 differentiation of acute drug effects from a preexisting mental disorder.
