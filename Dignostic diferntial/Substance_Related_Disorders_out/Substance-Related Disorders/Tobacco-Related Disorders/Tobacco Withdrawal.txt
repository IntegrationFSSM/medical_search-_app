Differential Diagnosis
 The symptoms of tobacco withdrawal overlap with those of other substance withdrawal
 syndromes (e.g., alcohol withdrawal; sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic withdrawal; stimulant
 withdrawal; caffeine withdrawal; opioid withdrawal); caffeine intoxication; anxiety, depressive,
 bipolar, and sleep disorders; and medication-induced akathisia. Admission to smoke-free
 inpatient units or voluntary smoking cessation can induce withdrawal symptoms that mimic,
 intensify, or disguise other disorders or adverse effects of medications used to treat mental
 disorders (e.g., irritability thought to be due to alcohol withdrawal could be due to tobacco
 withdrawal). Reduction in symptoms with the use of nicotine confirms the diagnosis.
