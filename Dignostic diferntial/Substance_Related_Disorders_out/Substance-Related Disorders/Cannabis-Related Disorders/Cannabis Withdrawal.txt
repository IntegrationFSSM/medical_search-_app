Differential Diagnosis
 Because many of the symptoms of cannabis withdrawal are also symptoms of other substance
 withdrawal syndromes or of depressive or bipolar disorders, careful evaluation should focus on
 ensuring that the symptoms are not better explained by cessation of another substance (e.g.,
 tobacco or alcohol withdrawal), another mental disorder (generalized anxiety disorder, major
 depressive disorder), or another medical condition. Given the increasingly common belief that
 cannabis use is harmless, regular cannabis users experiencing cannabis withdrawal may not
 realize that their withdrawal symptoms are due to the effects of cannabis wearing off, and
 continue to use cannabis as a form of self-medication
