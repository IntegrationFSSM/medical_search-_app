Differential Diagnosis
 Other substance intoxication.
 Note that if the clinical presentation includes hallucinations in the absence of intact reality
 testing, a diagnosis of substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder should be considered.
 Cannabis intoxication may resemble intoxication with other types of
 substances. However, in contrast to cannabis intoxication, alcohol intoxication and sedative,
 hypnotic, or anxiolytic intoxication frequently decrease appetite, increase aggressive behavior,
 and produce nystagmus or ataxia. Hallucinogens in low doses may cause a clinical picture that
 resembles cannabis intoxication. Phencyclidine, like cannabis, can be smoked and also causes
 perceptual changes, but phencyclidine intoxication is much more likely to cause ataxia and
 aggressive behavior.
 Cannabis-induced mental disorders.
 Cannabis intoxication is distinguished from cannabis-induced
 mental disorders (e.g., cannabis-induced anxiety disorder, with onset during intoxication)
 because the symptoms (e.g., anxiety) in these latter disorders are in excess of those usually
 associated with cannabis intoxication, predominate in the clinical presentation, and are severe
 enough to warrant independent clinical attention.
