Differential Diagnosis
 Nonproblematic use of cannabis.
 Although the majority of individuals who use cannabis do not
 have problems related to its use, 20%–30% of cannabis users do experience symptoms and
 associated consequences consistent with a cannabis use disorder. Differentiating nonproblematic
 use of cannabis and cannabis use disorder can be challenging because individuals may not
 attribute cannabis-related social, behavioral, or psychological problems to the substance,
 especially in the context of polysubstance use. Also, failure to acknowledge heavy cannabis use
 and its role in associated problems is common among individuals referred to treatment by others
 (i.e., school, family, employer, criminal justice system).
 Cannabis intoxication, cannabis withdrawal, and cannabis-induced mental disorders.
 Cannabis 
use
 disorder is differentiated from cannabis intoxication, cannabis withdrawal, and cannabis-induced
 mental disorders (e.g., cannabis-induced anxiety disorder) in that cannabis use disorder describes
 a problematic pattern of cannabis use that involves impaired control over cannabis use, social
 impairment due to cannabis use, risky cannabis use (e.g., driving while intoxicated), and
 pharmacological symptoms (the development of tolerance or withdrawal), whereas cannabis
 intoxication, cannabis withdrawal, and cannabis-induced mental disorders describe psychiatric
 syndromes that develop in the context of heavy use. Cannabis intoxication, cannabis withdrawal,
 and cannabis-induced mental disorders occur frequently in individuals with cannabis use
 disorder. In such cases, a diagnosis of cannabis intoxication, cannabis withdrawal, or a cannabis
induced mental disorder should be given in addition to a diagnosis of cannabis use disorder, the
 presence of which is indicated in the diagnostic code.
