Differential Diagnosis
 Other medical conditions.
 The symptoms of alcohol withdrawal can also be mimicked by some
 medical conditions (e.g., hypoglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis). Essential tremor,
 567
 a disorder that frequently runs in families, may erroneously suggest the tremulousness associated
 with alcohol withdrawal.
Alcohol-induced mental disorders.
 Alcohol withdrawal is distinguished from alcohol-induced
 mental disorders (e.g., alcohol-induced anxiety disorder, with onset during withdrawal) because
 the symptoms (e.g., anxiety) in these latter disorders are in excess of those usually associated
 with alcohol withdrawal, predominate in the clinical presentation, and are severe enough to
 warrant clinical attention.
 Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic withdrawal.
 Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic withdrawal produces a
 syndrome very similar to that of alcohol withdrawal.
