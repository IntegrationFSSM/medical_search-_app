Differential Diagnosis
 Other medical conditions.
 Several medical (e.g., diabetic acidosis) and neurological conditions
 Alcohol-induced mental disorders.
 (e.g., cerebellar ataxia, multiple sclerosis) can temporarily resemble alcohol intoxication.
 Alcohol intoxication is distinguished from alcohol-induced
 mental disorders (e.g., alcohol-induced depressive disorder, with onset during intoxication)
 because the symptoms (e.g., depressed mood) in these latter disorders are in excess of those
 usually associated with alcohol intoxication, predominate in the clinical presentation, and are
 severe enough to warrant clinical attention.
 Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic intoxication.
 Intoxication with sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic
 drugs or with other sedating substances (e.g., antihistamines, anticholinergic drugs) can be
 mistaken for alcohol intoxication. The differential requires observing alcohol on the breath,
 measuring blood or breath alcohol levels, ordering a medical workup, and gathering a good
 history. The signs and symptoms of sedative-hypnotic intoxication are very similar to those
 observed with alcohol and include similar problematic behavioral or psychological changes.
 These changes are accompanied by evidence of impaired functioning and judgment—which, if
 intense, can result in a life-threatening coma—and levels of incoordination that can interfere with
 driving abilities and with performing usual activities. However, there is no smell as there is with
 alcohol, but there is likely to be evidence of misuse of the depressant drug in the blood or urine
 toxicology analyses.
