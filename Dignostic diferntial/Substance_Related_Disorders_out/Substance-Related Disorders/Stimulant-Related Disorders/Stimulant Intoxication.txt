Differential Diagnosis
 Stimulant-induced mental disorders. Stimulant intoxication is distinguished from stimulant-induced
 mental disorders (e.g., stimulant-induced anxiety disorder, with onset during intoxication)
 because the symptoms (e.g., anxiety) in the latter disorders are in excess of those usually seen in
 stimulant intoxication, predominate in the clinical presentation, and meet full criteria for the
 relevant disorder.
  Independent mental disorders. Salient mental disturbances associated with stimulant intoxication
 should be distinguished from the symptoms of schizophrenia, bipolar and depressive disorders,
 generalized anxiety disorder, and panic disorder as described in this manual.
