Differential Diagnosis
 Phencyclidine intoxication.
 Intoxication with phencyclidine (PCP or “angel dust”) or synthetic
 “designer drugs” such as mephedrone (known by different names, including “bath salts”) may
 cause a similar clinical picture and can only be distinguished from stimulant intoxication by the
 presence of cocaine or amphetamine-type substance metabolites in a urine or plasma sample.
 Stimulant intoxication, stimulant withdrawal, and stimulant-induced mental disorders.
 Stimulant 
use
 disorder is differentiated from stimulant intoxication, stimulant withdrawal, and stimulant
induced mental disorders (e.g., stimulant-induced depressive disorder) in that stimulant use
 disorder describes a problematic pattern of stimulant use that involves impaired control over
 stimulant use, social impairment attributable to stimulant use, risky stimulant use (e.g., continued
 stimulant use despite medical complications), and pharmacological symptoms (the development
 of tolerance or withdrawal), whereas stimulant

 intoxication, stimulant withdrawal, and stimulant-induced mental disorders describe psychiatric
 syndromes that occur in the context of heavy use. Stimulant intoxication, stimulant withdrawal,
 and stimulant-induced mental disorders occur frequently in individuals with stimulant use
 disorder. In such cases, a diagnosis of stimulant intoxication, stimulant withdrawal, or a
 stimulant-induced mental disorder should be given in addition to a diagnosis of stimulant use
 disorder, the presence of which is indicated in the diagnostic code.
 Independent mental disorders.
 Some of the effects of stimulant use may resemble symptoms of
 independent mental disorders, such as psychosis (schizophrenia) and low mood (major
depressive disorder). Discerning whether these behaviors occurred before the intake of the drug
 is important in the differentiation of acute drug effects from a preexisting mental disorder.
