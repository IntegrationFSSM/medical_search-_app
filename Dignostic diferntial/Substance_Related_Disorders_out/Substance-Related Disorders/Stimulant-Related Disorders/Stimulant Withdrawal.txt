Differential Diagnosis
 Stimulant-induced mental disorders. Stimulant withdrawal is distinguished from stimulant-induced
 mental disorders (e.g., stimulant-induced depressive disorder, with onset during withdrawal)
 because the symptoms (e.g., depressed mood) in these latter disorders are in excess of those
 usually associated with stimulant withdrawal, predominate in the clinical presentation, and are
 severe enough to warrant clinical attention
