Differential Diagnosis
 Dose reduction after extended dosing, but not meeting the criteria for other (or unknown)
 substance withdrawal.
 The individual used other (or unknown) substances, but the dose that was used was insufficient
 to produce symptoms that meet the criteria required for the withdrawal diagnosis.
 Substance withdrawal or other substance/medication-induced mental disorders.
 Familiar 
substances
 may be sold in the black market as novel products, and individuals may experience withdrawal
 when discontinuing those substances. History, toxicology screens, or
 660
 chemical testing of the substance itself may help to identify it. Other substance withdrawal is
 distinguished from other substance/medication-induced mental disorders (e.g., venlafaxine
induced anxiety disorder, with onset during withdrawal) because the symptoms (e.g., anxiety) in
 these latter disorders are in excess of symptoms (if known) usually associated with the specific
 substance withdrawal, predominate in the clinical presentation, and are severe enough to warrant
 clinical attention.
 Other toxic, metabolic, traumatic, neoplastic, vascular, or infectious disorders that impair brain
 function and cognition.
 Numerous neurological and other medical conditions may produce rapid onset of signs and
 symptoms mimicking those of withdrawals. Paradoxically, drug intoxications also must be ruled
 out; for example, lethargy may indicate withdrawal from one drug or intoxication with another
 substance.
