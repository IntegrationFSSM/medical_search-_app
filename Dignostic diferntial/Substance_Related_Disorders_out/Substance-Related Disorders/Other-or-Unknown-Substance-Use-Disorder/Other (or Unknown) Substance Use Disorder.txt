Differential Diagnosis
 Use of other or unknown substances without meeting criteria for other (or unknown) substance
 use disorder.
 Use of unknown substances is not rare among adolescents, but most use does not meet the
 diagnostic standard of two or more criteria for other (or unknown) substance use disorder in a
 12-month period.
 Substance use disorders.
 Other (or unknown) substance use disorder may co-occur with various
 substance use disorders that involve any of the nine substance classes presented earlier in this
 chapter, and the symptoms of the disorders may be similar and overlapping. To disentangle
 symptom patterns, it is helpful to inquire about which symptoms persisted during periods when
 some of the substances were not being used.
 Other (or unknown) substance intoxication, other (or unknown) substance withdrawal, and
 other (or unknown) substance–induced mental disorders.
 Other (or unknown) substance use disorder is differentiated from other (or unknown) substance
 intoxication, other (or unknown) substance withdrawal, and other-(or unknown) substance
induced mental disorders (e.g., corticosteroid-induced bipolar and related disorder) in that other
 (or unknown) substance use disorder describes a problematic pattern of use of the other (or
 unknown) substance that involves impaired control over the use of the substance, social
impairment attributable to use of the substance, risky use of the substance (e.g., continued use
 despite medical complications), and pharmacological symptoms (the development of
 656
 tolerance or withdrawal), whereas other (or unknown) substance intoxication, other (or
 unknown) substance withdrawal, and other (or unknown) substance-induced mental disorders
 describe psychiatric syndromes that occur in the context of heavy use. Other (or unknown)
 substance intoxication, other (or unknown) substance withdrawal, and other (or unknown)
 substance–induced mental disorders may occur in individuals with other (or unknown) substance
 use disorder. In such cases, a diagnosis of other (or unknown) substance intoxication, other (or
 unknown) substance withdrawal, or other (or unknown) substance–induced mental disorder
 should be given in addition to a diagnosis of other (or unknown) substance use disorder, the
 presence of which is indicated in the diagnostic code.
