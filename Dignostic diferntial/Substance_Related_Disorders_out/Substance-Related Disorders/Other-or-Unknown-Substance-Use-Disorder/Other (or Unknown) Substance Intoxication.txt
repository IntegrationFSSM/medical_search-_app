Differential Diagnosis
 Use of other or unknown substance, without meeting criteria for other (or unknown) substance
 intoxication.
 The individual used an other or unknown substance(s), but the dose was insufficient to produce
 symptoms that meet the diagnostic criteria required for the diagnosis.

 Substance intoxication or other substance/medication-induced mental disorders.
 Familiar 
substances
 may be sold in the black market as novel products, and individuals may experience intoxication
 from those substances. History, toxicology screens, or chemical testing of the substance itself
 may help to identify it. Other substance intoxication is distinguished from other
 substance/medication-induced mental disorders (e.g., corticosteroid-induced anxiety disorder)
 because the symptoms (e.g., anxiety) in these latter disorders are in excess of those (if known)
 usually associated with the specific substance intoxication, predominate in the clinical
 presentation, and are severe enough to warrant clinical attention.
 Other toxic, metabolic, traumatic, neoplastic, vascular, or infectious disorders that impair brain
 function and cognition.
 Numerous neurological and other medical conditions may produce rapid onset of signs and
 symptoms mimicking those of intoxications, including the examples in Criterion B.
 Paradoxically, drug withdrawals also must be ruled out; for example, lethargy may indicate
 withdrawal from one drug or intoxication with another substance.
