Differential Diagnosis
 Other substance intoxication. Alcohol intoxication and sedative-hypnotic intoxication can cause a
 clinical picture that resembles opioid intoxication. A diagnosis of alcohol or sedative-hypnotic
 intoxication can usually be made based on the absence of pupillary constriction or the lack of a
 response to a naloxone challenge. In some cases, intoxication may be due both to opioids and to
 alcohol or other sedatives. In these cases, naloxone administration will not reverse all of the
 sedative effects. While response to administration of

 naloxone can support the diagnosis of opioid intoxication, nonresponse may be due to the co
ingestion of an opioid with another drug (e.g., a benzodiazepine, alcohol) or to ingestion of a
 higher dose of and/or higher-potency opioid (e.g., fentanyl).
 Opioid intoxication is distinguished from opioid-induced mental
 disorders (e.g., opioid-induced depressive disorder, with onset during intoxication) because the
 symptoms (e.g., depressed mood) in the latter disorders are in excess of those usually associated
 with opioid intoxication, predominate in the clinical presentation, and are severe enough to
 warrant clinical attention.
