Differential Diagnosis
 Alcohol use disorder.
 Because the clinical presentations may be identical, distinguishing sedative,
 hypnotic, or anxiolytic intoxication from alcohol use disorder requires evidence for recent
 ingestion of sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic medications by self-report, informant report, or
 toxicological testing. Many individuals who misuse sedatives, hypnotics, or anxiolytics may also
 misuse alcohol and other substances, and so multiple intoxication diagnoses are possible.
 Alcohol intoxication.
 Alcohol intoxication may be distinguished from sedative, hypnotic, or
 anxiolytic intoxication by the smell of alcohol on the breath. Otherwise, the features of the two
 disorders may be similar.
 Sedative-, hypnotic-, or anxiolytic-induced mental disorders.
 Sedative, 
hypnotic, 
or 
anxiolytic
 intoxication is distinguished from sedative-, hypnotic-, or anxiolytic-induced mental disorders
 (e.g., sedative-, hypnotic-, or anxiolytic-induced anxiety disorder, with onset during withdrawal)
 because the symptoms (e.g., anxiety) in the latter disorders are in excess of those usually
 associated with sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic intoxication; predominate in the clinical
 presentation; and are severe enough to warrant clinical attention.
 Neurocognitive disorders.
 In situations of cognitive impairment, traumatic brain injury, and
 delirium from other causes, sedatives, hypnotics, or anxiolytics may be intoxicating at quite low
 dosages. The differential diagnosis in these complex settings is based on the predominant
 syndrome. An additional diagnosis of sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic intoxication may be
 appropriate even if the substance has been ingested at a low dosage in the setting of these other
(or similar) co-occurring conditions.
