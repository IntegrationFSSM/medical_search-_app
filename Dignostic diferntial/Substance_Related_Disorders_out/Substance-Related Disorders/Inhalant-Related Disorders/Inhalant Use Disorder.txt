Differential Diagnosis
 Inhalant exposure (unintentional) from industrial or other accidents.
 disorder only applies if the inhalant exposure is intentional.
 A diagnosis of inhalant use
 Inhalant intoxication, without meeting criteria for inhalant use disorder.
 Inhalant intoxication occurs
 frequently during inhalant use disorder but also may occur among individuals whose use does
 not meet criteria for inhalant use disorder.
 Inhalant intoxication meeting criteria for inhalant use disorder, and inhalant-induced mental
 disorders.
 Inhalant use disorder is differentiated from inhalant intoxication and inhalant-induced mental
 disorders (e.g., inhalant-induced depressive disorder) in that inhalant use disorder describes a
 problematic pattern of inhalant use that involves impaired control over inhalant use, social
 impairment attributable to inhalant use, risky inhalant use (e.g., inhalant use despite medical
 complications), and pharmacological symptoms (the development of tolerance), whereas inhalant
 intoxication and inhalant-induced mental disorders describe psychiatric syndromes that develop
 in the context of heavy use. Inhalant intoxication and inhalant-induced mental disorders occur
 frequently in individuals with inhalant use disorder. In such cases, a diagnosis of inhalant
 intoxication or an inhalant-induced mental disorder should be given in addition to a diagnosis of
 inhalant use disorder, the presence of which is indicated in the diagnostic code.
 Other substance use disorders, especially those involving sedating substances (e.g., alcohol,
 benzodiazepines, barbiturates).
 Inhalant use disorder commonly co-occurs with other substance use disorders, and the symptoms
 of the disorders may be similar and overlapping. To disentangle symptom patterns, it is helpful
 to inquire about which symptoms persisted during periods when some of the substances were not
 being used.
