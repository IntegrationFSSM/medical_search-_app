Differential Diagnosis
 Intoxication from other substances, especially from sedating substances (e.g., alcohol,
 benzodiazepines, barbiturates).
 These disorders may have similar signs and symptoms, but intoxication attributable to other
 intoxicants may be identified via a toxicology screen. Differentiating the source of the
 intoxication may involve discerning evidence of inhalant exposure as described for inhalant use
 disorder. A diagnosis of inhalant intoxication may be suggested by possession or lingering odors
 of inhalant substances (e.g., glue, paint thinner, gasoline, butane lighters); paraphernalia
 possession (e.g., rags or bags for concentrating glue fumes); perioral or perinasal “glue-sniffer’s
 rash”; reports from family or friends that the intoxicated individual possesses or uses inhalants;
 or apparent intoxication despite negative results on standard drug screens (which usually fail to
 identify inhalants).
 Inhalant-induced mental disorders.
 Inhalant intoxication is distinguished from inhalant-induced
 mental disorders (e.g., inhalant-induced anxiety disorder, with onset during intoxication) because
 the symptoms (e.g., anxiety) in these latter disorders are in excess of those usually associated
 with inhalant intoxication, predominate in the clinical presentation, and are severe enough to
 warrant independent clinical attention.
 Other toxic, metabolic, traumatic, neoplastic, or infectious disorders that impair brain function
 and cognition.
 Numerous neurological and other medical conditions may produce the clinically significant
 behavioral or psychological changes (e.g., belligerence, assaultiveness, apathy, impaired
 judgment) that also characterize inhalant intoxication.
