Differential Diagnosis
 Nondisordered gambling.
 Gambling disorder must be distinguished from professional and social
 gambling. In professional gambling, risks are limited and discipline is central. Social gambling
 typically occurs with friends or colleagues and lasts for a limited period of time, with acceptable
 losses. Some persons can experience problems associated with gambling (e.g., short-term
 chasing behavior and loss of control) that do not meet the full criteria for gambling disorder.
 Manic episode.
 Loss of judgment and excessive gambling may occur during a manic episode. An
 additional diagnosis of gambling disorder should be given only if the gambling behavior is not
 better explained by manic episodes (e.g., a history of maladaptive gambling behavior at times
 other than during a manic episode). Alternatively, an individual with gambling disorder may,
during a period of gambling, exhibit behavior that resembles a manic episode, but once the
 individual is away from the gambling, these manic-like features dissipate.
 Personality disorders.
 Problems with gambling may occur in individuals with antisocial
 personality disorder and other personality disorders. If the criteria are met for both disorders,
 both can be diagnosed.
 Gambling symptoms due to dopaminergic medications.
 Some individuals taking dopaminergic
 medications (e.g., for Parkinson‘s disease) may experience urges to gamble that might be
 distressing or impairing enough to meet criteria for gambling disorder. In such cases, a diagnosis
 of gambling disorder would be warranted.
