Differential Diagnosis
 Eating of nonnutritive, nonfood substances may occur during the course of other mental
disorders (e.g., autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia) and in Kleine-Levin syndrome. In any
 such instance, an additional diagnosis of pica should be given only if the eating behavior is
 sufficiently persistent and severe to warrant additional clinical attention.
 Anorexia nervosa.
 Pica can usually be distinguished from the other feeding and eating disorders
 by the consumption of nonnutritive, nonfood substances. It is important to note, however, that
 some presentations of anorexia nervosa include ingestion of nonnutritive, nonfood substances,
 such as paper tissues, as a means of attempting to control appetite. In such cases, when the eating
 of nonnutritive, nonfood substances is primarily used as a means of weight control, anorexia
 nervosa should be the primary diagnosis.
 Factitious disorder.
 Some individuals with factitious disorder may intentionally ingest foreign
 objects as part of the pattern of falsification of physical symptoms. In such instances, there is an
 element of deception that is consistent with deliberate induction of injury or disease.
 Nonsuicidal self-injury and nonsuicidal self-injury behaviors in personality disorders.
 Some individuals
 may swallow potentially harmful items (e.g., pins, needles, knives) in the context of maladaptive
 behavior patterns associated with personality disorders or nonsuicidal self-injury.
