Differential Diagnosis
 Anorexia nervosa, binge-eating/purging type.
 Individuals whose binge-eating behavior occurs only
 during episodes of anorexia nervosa are given the diagnosis anorexia nervosa, binge
eating/purging type, and should not be given the additional diagnosis of bulimia nervosa. For
 individuals with an initial diagnosis of anorexia nervosa who binge and purge but whose
 presentation no longer meets the full criteria for anorexia nervosa, binge-eating/purging type
 (e.g., when weight is normal), a diagnosis of bulimia nervosa should be given only when all
 criteria for bulimia nervosa have been met for at least 3 months.

 Binge-eating disorder.
 Some individuals binge eat but do not engage in regular inappropriate
 compensatory behaviors. In these cases, the diagnosis of binge-eating disorder should be
 considered.
 Kleine-Levin syndrome.
 In certain neurological or other medical conditions, such as Kleine-Levin
 syndrome, there is disturbed eating behavior, but the characteristic psychological features of
 bulimia nervosa, such as overconcern with body shape and weight, are not present.
 Major depressive disorder, with atypical features.
 Overeating is common in major depressive
 disorder, with atypical features, but individuals with this disorder do not engage in inappropriate
 compensatory behaviors and do not exhibit the excessive concern with body shape and weight
 characteristic of bulimia nervosa. If criteria for both disorders are met, both diagnoses should be
 given.
 Borderline personality disorder.
 Binge-eating behavior is included in the impulsive behavior
 criterion that is part of the definition of borderline personality disorder. If the criteria for both
 borderline personality disorder and bulimia nervosa are met, both diagnoses should be given.
