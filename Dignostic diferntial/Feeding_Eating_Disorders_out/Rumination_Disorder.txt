Differential Diagnosis
 Gastrointestinal conditions.
 It is important to differentiate regurgitation in rumination disorder
 from other conditions characterized by gastroesophageal reflux or vomiting, such as
 gastroparesis, pyloric stenosis, hiatal hernia, and Sandifer syndrome in infants. These other
 medical conditions can usually be ruled out on the basis of history and clinical observation.
 Anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa.
 Individuals with anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa may
 also engage in regurgitation with subsequent spitting out of food as a means of disposing of
 ingested calories because of concerns about weight gain.
