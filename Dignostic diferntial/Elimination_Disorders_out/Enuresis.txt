Differential Diagnosis
 Neurogenic bladder or another medical condition.
 The diagnosis of enuresis is not made in the
 presence of a neurogenic bladder or any other structural condition (such as a posterior urethral
 valve or ectopic ureter) or another medical condition that causes polyuria or
 402
 urgency (e.g., untreated diabetes mellitus or diabetes insipidus) or during an acute urinary tract
 infection. However, a diagnosis is compatible with such medical conditions if urinary
 incontinence was regularly present prior to the development of another medical condition or if it
 persists after the institution of appropriate treatment of the medical condition.
 Medication side effects.
 Enuresis may occur during treatment with antipsychotic medications,
 diuretics, or other medications that may induce constipation, polyuria, or alterations in executive
 functioning, all of which may lead to incontinence. In this case, the diagnosis should not be made
 in isolation but may be noted as a medication side effect. However, a diagnosis of enuresis may
 be made if urinary incontinence was regularly present prior to treatment with the medication.
