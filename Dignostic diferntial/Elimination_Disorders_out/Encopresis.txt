Differential Diagnosis
 A diagnosis of encopresis in the presence of another medical condition is appropriate only if the
 mechanism involves constipation that cannot be explained by other medical conditions. Fecal
 incontinence related to other medical conditions (e.g., chronic diarrhea, spina bifida, anal
 stenosis) would not warrant a DSM-5 diagnosis of encopresis.
