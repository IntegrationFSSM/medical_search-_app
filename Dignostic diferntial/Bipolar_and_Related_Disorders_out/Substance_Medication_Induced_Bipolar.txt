Differential Diagnosis
 Substance/medication-induced bipolar and related disorder should be differentiated from other
 bipolar disorders, substance intoxication, substance withdrawal, substance-induced delirium, and
 medication side effects (as noted earlier). A full manic episode that emerges during
 antidepressant treatment (e.g., medication, electroconvulsive therapy) but persists at a fully
 syndromal level beyond the physiological effect of that treatment is sufficient evidence for a
 bipolar I diagnosis. A full hypomanic episode that emerges during antidepressant treatment (e.g.,
 medication, electroconvulsive therapy) but persists at a fully syndromal level beyond the
 physiological effect of that treatment is sufficient evidence for a bipolar II diagnosis only if
 preceded by a major depressive episode.
 Substance intoxication and substance withdrawal.
 Euphoria, irritability, and increased energy may
 occur in substance intoxication (e.g., stimulant intoxication) or substance withdrawal (e.g.,
 cannabis withdrawal). The diagnosis of the substance-specific intoxication or substance-specific
 withdrawal will usually suffice to categorize the symptom presentation. A diagnosis of
 substance/medication-induced bipolar and related disorder either with onset during intoxication
 or with onset during withdrawal should be made instead of a diagnosis of substance intoxication
 or substance withdrawal when the euphoric or irritable mood or increased energy symptoms are
 predominant in the clinical picture and are sufficiently severe to warrant clinical attention.
