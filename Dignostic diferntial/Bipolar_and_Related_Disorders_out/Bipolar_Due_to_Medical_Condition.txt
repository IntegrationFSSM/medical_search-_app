Differential Diagnosis
 Delirium and major or mild neurocognitive disorder. A separate diagnosis of bipolar and related
 disorder due to another medical condition is not given if the mood disturbance occurs exclusively
 during the course of a delirium. However, a diagnosis of bipolar and related disorder due to
 another medical condition may be given in addition to a diagnosis of major or mild
 neurocognitive disorder if the mood disturbance is judged to be a physiological consequence of
 the pathological process causing the neurocognitive disorder and if symptoms of irritability or
 elevated mood are a prominent part of the clinical presentation.

  Symptoms of catatonia and acute anxiety.It is important to differentiate symptoms of mania from
 excited catatonic symptoms and from agitation related to acute anxiety states.
 Medication-induced depressive or manic symptoms. An important differential diagnostic observation
 is that the other medical condition may be treated with medications (e.g., steroids or alpha
interferon) that can induce depressive or manic symptoms. In these cases, clinical judgment
 using all of the evidence in hand is the best way to try to separate the most likely and/or the most
 important of two etiological factors (i.e., association with the medical condition vs. a
 substance/medication-induced syndrome). The differential diagnosis of the associated medical
 conditions is relevant but largely beyond the scope of the present manual.
