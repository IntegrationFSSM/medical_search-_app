Differential Diagnosis
 Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.
 Abnormalities of attention (overly focused or easily
 distracted) are common in individuals with autism spectrum disorder, as is hyperactivity.
 Moreover, some individuals with ADHD may exhibit social communication deficits such as
 interrupting others, speaking too loudly, and not respecting personal space. Although potentially
 difficult to discriminate ADHD from autism spectrum disorder, the developmental course and
 absence of restricted, repetitive behaviors and unusual interests in ADHD help in differentiating
 the two conditions. A concurrent diagnosis of ADHD should be considered when attentional
 difficulties or hyperactivity exceeds that typically seen in individuals of comparable mental age,
 and ADHD is one of the most common comorbidities in autism spectrum disorder.
 Intellectual developmental disorder (intellectual disability) without autism spectrum disorder.
 Intellectual
 developmental disorder without autism spectrum disorder may be difficult to differentiate from
autism spectrum disorder in very young children. Individuals with intellectual developmental
 disorder who have not developed language or symbolic skills also present a challenge for
 differential diagnosis, since repetitive behavior often occurs in such individuals as well. A
 diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder in an individual with intellectual developmental disorder
 is appropriate when social communication and interaction are significantly impaired relative to
 the developmental level of the individual’s nonverbal skills (e.g., fine motor skills, nonverbal
 problem solving). In contrast, intellectual developmental disorder is the appropriate diagnosis
 when there is no apparent discrepancy between the level of social communicative skills and other
 intellectual skills.
 Language disorders and social (pragmatic) communication disorder.
 In some forms of language
 disorder, there may be problems of communication and some secondary social difficulties.
 However, specific language disorder is not usually associated with abnormal nonverbal
 communication, nor with the presence of restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or
 activities.
 When an individual shows impairment in social communication and social interactions but
 does not show restricted and repetitive behavior or interests, criteria for social (pragmatic)
 communication disorder, instead of autism spectrum disorder, may be met. The diagnosis of
 autism spectrum disorder supersedes that of social (pragmatic) communication disorder
 whenever the criteria for autism spectrum disorder are met, and care should be taken to enquire
 carefully regarding past or current restricted/repetitive behavior.
 Selective mutism.
 In selective mutism, early development is not typically disturbed. The affected
 child usually exhibits appropriate communication skills in certain contexts and settings. Even in
 settings where the child is mute, social reciprocity is not impaired, nor are restricted or repetitive
 patterns of behavior present.
 Stereotypic movement disorder.
 Motor stereotypies are among the diagnostic characteristics of
 autism spectrum disorder, so an additional diagnosis of stereotypic movement disorder is not
 given when such repetitive behaviors are better explained by the presence
 67
 of autism spectrum disorder. However, when stereotypies cause self-injury and become a focus
 of treatment, both diagnoses may be appropriate.
 Rett syndrome.
 Disruption of social interaction may be observed during the regressive phase of
 Rett syndrome (typically between ages 1 and 4 years); thus, a substantial proportion of affected
 young girls may have a presentation that meets diagnostic criteria for autism spectrum disorder.
 However, after this period, most individuals with Rett syndrome improve their social
 communication skills, and autistic features are no longer a major area of concern. Consequently,
 autism spectrum disorder should be considered only when all diagnostic criteria are met.
 Symptoms associated with anxiety disorders.
 The overlap of anxiety symptoms with the core
 symptoms of autism spectrum disorder can make the classification of anxiety symptoms in
 autism spectrum disorder challenging. For example, social withdrawal and repetitive behaviors
 are core features of autism spectrum disorder but may also be expressions of anxiety. The most
 common anxiety disorders in autism spectrum disorder are specific phobia (in up to 30% of
 cases), and social anxiety and agoraphobia (in as many as 17% of cases).
Obsessive-compulsive disorder.
 Repetitive behavior is a defining feature of both obsessive
compulsive disorder and autism spectrum disorder. In both conditions, repetitive behaviors are
 considered to be inappropriate or odd. In obsessive-compulsive disorder, intrusive thoughts are
 often related to contamination, organization, or sexual or religious themes. Compulsions are
 performed in response to these intrusive thoughts in attempts to relieve anxiety. In autism
 spectrum disorder, repetitive behaviors classically include more stereotyped motor behaviors,
 such as hand flapping and finger shaking or more complex behaviors, such as insistence on
 routines or lining up objects. Contrary to obsessive-compulsive disorder, repetitive behaviors in
 autism spectrum disorder may be perceived as pleasurable and reinforcing.
 Schizophrenia.
 Schizophrenia with childhood onset usually develops after a period of normal, or
 near normal, development. A prodromal state has been described in which social impairment and
 atypical interests and beliefs occur, which could be confused with the social deficits and
 restricted fixated interests seen in autism spectrum disorder. Hallucinations and delusions, which
 are defining features of schizophrenia, are not features of autism spectrum disorder. However,
 clinicians must take into account the potential for individuals with autism spectrum disorder to
 be concrete in their interpretation of questions regarding the key features of schizophrenia (e.g.,
 “Do you hear voices when no one is there?” ”Yes [on the radio]”). Autism spectrum disorder and
 schizophrenia can co-occur, and both should be diagnosed when criteria are met.
 Personality disorders.
 In adults without intellectual developmental disorder or significant
 language impairment, some behaviors associated with autism spectrum disorder may be
 perceived by others as symptoms of narcissistic, schizotypal, or schizoid personality disorder.
 Schizotypal personality disorder in particular may intersect with autism spectrum disorder in
 unusual preoccupations and perceptual experiences, odd thinking and speech, constricted affect
 and social anxiety, lack of close friends, and odd or eccentric behavior. The early developmental
 course of autism spectrum disorder (lack of imaginative play, restricted/repetitive behavior,
 sensory sensitivities) is most helpful in differentiating it from personality disorders.
