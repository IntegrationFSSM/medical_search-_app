Differential Diagnosis
 Normal variations in speech.
 Regional, social, or cultural/ethnic variations of speech should be
 considered before making the diagnosis. Bilingual children may demonstrate an overall lower
 intelligibility rating, make more overall consonant and vowel errors, and produce more
 uncommon error patterns than monolingual English-speaking children when assessed only in
 English.
 Hearing or other sensory impairment.
 Those who are deaf or hard of hearing may have speech
 sound production errors. When speech deficits are in excess of those usually associated with
 these problems, a diagnosis of speech sound disorder may be made.
 Structural deficits.
 Dysarthria.
 Speech impairment may be due to structural deficits (e.g., cleft palate).
 Speech impairment may be attributable to a motor disorder, such as cerebral palsy.
 Neurological signs, as well as distinctive features of voice, differentiate dysarthria from speech
 sound disorder, although in young children (under 3 years) differentiation may be difficult,
 particularly when there is no or minimal general body motor involvement (as in, e.g., Worster
Drought syndrome).
 Selective mutism.
 Limited use of speech may be a sign of selective mutism, an anxiety disorder
 that is characterized by a lack of speech in one or more contexts or settings. Selective mutism
 may develop in children with a speech disorder because of embarrassment about their
 impairments, but many children with selective mutism exhibit normal speech in “safe” settings,
 such as at home or with close friends.
