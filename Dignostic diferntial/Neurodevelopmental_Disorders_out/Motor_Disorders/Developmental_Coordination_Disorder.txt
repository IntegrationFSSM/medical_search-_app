Differential Diagnosis
 Motor impairments due to another medical condition.
 Problems in coordination may be associated
 with visual function impairment and specific neurological disorders (e.g., cerebral palsy,
 progressive lesions of the cerebellum, neuromuscular disorders). In such cases, there are
 additional findings on neurological examination.
 Intellectual developmental disorder (intellectual disability).
 If intellectual developmental disorder is
 present, motor competences may be impaired in accordance with the intellectual disability.
 However, if the motor difficulties are in excess of what could be accounted for by the intellectual
 developmental disorder, and criteria for developmental coordination disorder are met,
 developmental coordination disorder can be diagnosed as well.
Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.
 Autism spectrum disorder.
 Joint hypermobility syndrome.

 Individuals with ADHD may fall, bump into objects, or
 knock things over. Careful observation across different contexts is required to ascertain if lack of
 motor competence is attributable to distractibility and impulsiveness rather than to
 developmental coordination disorder. If criteria for both ADHD and developmental coordination
 disorder are met, both diagnoses can be given.
 Individuals with autism spectrum disorder may be uninterested in
 participating in tasks requiring complex coordination skills, such as ball sports, which will affect
 test performance and function but not reflect core motor competence. Co-occurrence of
 developmental coordination disorder and autism spectrum disorder is common. If criteria for
 both disorders are met, both diagnoses can be given.
 Individuals with syndromes causing hyperextensible joints (found
 on physical examination; often with a complaint of pain) may present with symptoms similar to
 those of developmental coordination disorder.
