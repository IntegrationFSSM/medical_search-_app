Differential Diagnosis
 The most important conditions in the differential diagnosis of RLS are leg cramps, positional
 discomfort, arthralgias/arthritis, myalgias, positional ischemia (numbness), leg edema, peripheral
 neuropathy, radiculopathy, and habitual foot tapping. Muscle cramps, relief with a single
 postural shift, limitation to joints, soreness to palpation (myalgias), and other abnormalities on
 physical examination are not characteristic of RLS. Unlike RLS, nocturnal leg cramps do not
 typically manifest with the desire to move the limbs nor are there frequent limb movements. Less
 common conditions to be differentiated from RLS include neuroleptic-induced akathisia,
 myelopathy, symptomatic venous insufficiency, peripheral artery disease, eczema, other
 orthopedic problems, and anxiety-induced restlessness. Worsening at night and periodic limb
 movements are more common in RLS than in medication-induced akathisia or peripheral
 neuropathy.
 While it is important that RLS symptoms not be solely accounted for by another medical or
 behavioral condition, it should also be appreciated that any of these similar conditions can occur
 in an individual with RLS. This necessitates a separate focus on each possible condition in the
 diagnostic process and when assessing impact. For cases in which the diagnosis of RLS is not
 certain, evaluation for the supportive features of RLS, particularly PLMS or a family history of
 RLS, may be helpful. Clinical features, such as response to a dopaminergic agent and positive
 family history for RLS, can help with the differential diagnosis.
