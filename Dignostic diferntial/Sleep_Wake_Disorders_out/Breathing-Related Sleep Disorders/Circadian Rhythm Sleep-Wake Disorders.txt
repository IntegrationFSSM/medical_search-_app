Differential Diagnosis
 Normative variations in sleep.
 Delayed sleep phase type must be distinguished from “normal” sleep
 patterns in which a person has a late schedule that does not cause personal, social, or
 occupational distress (most commonly seen in adolescents and young adults).
 Other sleep disorders.
 Insomnia disorder and other circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders should
 be included in the differential. Excessive sleepiness may also be caused by other sleep
 disturbances, such as breathing-related sleep disorders, insomnias, restless legs syndrome, and
 medical, neurological, and mental disorders. Overnight polysomnography may help in evaluating
 for other comorbid sleep disorders, such as sleep apnea. The circadian nature of delayed sleep
 phase type, however, should differentiate it from other disorders with similar complaints.
