Differential Diagnosis
 Other medical conditions affecting ventilation.
 In adults, the idiopathic variety of sleep-related
 hypoventilation is very uncommon and is determined by excluding the presence of lung diseases,
 skeletal malformations, neuromuscular disorders, and other medical and neurological disorders
 or medications that affect ventilation. Sleep-related hypoventilation must be distinguished from
 other causes of sleep-related hypoxemia, such as that due to lung disease.
 Other breathing-related sleep disorders.
 Sleep-related hypoventilation can be distinguished from
 obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea and central sleep apnea based on clinical features and findings
 on polysomnography. Sleep-related hypoventilation typically shows more sustained periods of
 oxygen desaturation rather than the periodic episodes seen in obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea
 and central sleep apnea. Obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea and central sleep apnea also show a
 pattern of discrete episodes of repeated airflow reductions that can be absent in sleep-related
 hypoventilation. However, both obstructive and central apneas and hypopneas can occur in
 association with sleep-related hypoventilation. In obesity hypoventilation, most individuals will
 have comorbid obstructive sleep apnea
