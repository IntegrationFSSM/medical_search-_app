Differential Diagnosis
 Idiopathic central sleep apnea must be distinguished from other breathing-related sleep disorders,
 other sleep disorders, and medical conditions and mental disorders that cause sleep
 fragmentation, sleepiness, and fatigue. This is achieved using polysomnography.
 Other breathing-related sleep disorders and sleep disorders.
 Central sleep apnea can be distinguished
 from obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea by the presence of at least five central apneas per hour of
 sleep. These conditions may co-occur, but central sleep apnea is considered to predominate when
 central respiratory events are > 50% of the total number of respiratory events.
 Cheyne-Stokes breathing can be distinguished from other mental disorders, including other
 sleep disorders, and other medical conditions that cause sleep fragmentation, sleepiness, and
 fatigue based on the presence of a predisposing condition (e.g., heart failure or stroke) and signs
 and polysomnographic evidence of the characteristic breathing pattern. Polysomnographic
 respiratory findings can help distinguish Cheyne-Stokes breathing from insomnia due to other
 medical conditions. For example, central sleep apnea due to high-altitude periodic breathing has
 a pattern that resembles Cheyne-Stokes breathing but has a shorter cycle time, occurs only at
 high altitude, and is not associated with heart failure.
 Central sleep apnea comorbid with opioid use can be differentiated from other types of
 breathing-related sleep disorders based on the use of long-acting opioid medications in
 conjunction with polysomnographic evidence of central apneas and periodic or ataxic breathing.
 It can be distinguished from insomnia due to drug or substance use based on polysomnographic
 evidence of central sleep apnea.
