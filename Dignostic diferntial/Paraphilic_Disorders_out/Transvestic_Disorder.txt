Differential Diagnosis
 Transvestism.
 Individuals with transvestism experience recurrent and intense sexual arousal from
 cross-dressing. Unless the fantasies, sexual urges, or behaviors involving cross-dressing are
 accompanied by clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other
 important areas of functioning, a diagnosis of transvestic disorder is not warranted.
 Fetishistic disorder.
 This disorder may resemble transvestic disorder, in particular, in men with
 fetishism who put on women’s undergarments while masturbating with them. Distinguishing
 transvestic disorder depends on the individual’s specific thoughts during such activity (e.g., are
 there any ideas of being a woman, being like a woman, or being dressed as a woman?) and on
 the presence of other fetishes (e.g., soft, silky fabrics, whether these are used for garments or for
 something else).
 Gender dysphoria.
 Individuals with transvestic disorder do not report an incongruence between
 their experienced gender and their assigned gender or a desire to be of the other gender; and they
 typically do not have a history of childhood cross-gender behaviors, which would be present in
 individuals with gender dysphoria. Individuals with a presentation that meets full criteria for
 transvestic disorder as well as gender dysphoria should be given both diagnoses.
