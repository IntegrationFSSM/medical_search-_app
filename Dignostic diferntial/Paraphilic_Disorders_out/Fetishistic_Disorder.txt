Differential Diagnosis
 Transvestic disorder.
 The nearest diagnostic neighbor of fetishistic disorder is transvestic
 disorder. As noted in the diagnostic criteria, fetishistic disorder is not diagnosed when fetish
 objects are limited to articles of clothing exclusively worn during cross-dressing (as in
 transvestic disorder), or when the object is genitally stimulating because it has been designed for
 that purpose (e.g., a vibrator).
 Sexual masochism disorder or other paraphilic disorders.
 Fetishistic disorder can co-occur with other
 paraphilic disorders, especially sadomasochistic behavior or interests and transvestic disorder.
 When an individual fantasizes about or engages in “forced cross-dressing” and is primarily
 sexually aroused by the domination or humiliation associated with such fantasy or repetitive
 activity, and experiences distress or functional impairment, the diagnosis of sexual masochism
 disorder should be made.
 Fetishism.
 Use of a fetish object for sexual arousal (fetishism) without any associated distress or
 psychosocial role impairment or other adverse consequence would not meet criteria for fetishistic
 disorder, as the threshold required by Criterion B would not be met. For example, an individual
 whose sexual partner either shares or can successfully incorporate his interest in caressing,
 smelling, or licking feet or toes as an important element of foreplay would not be diagnosed with
 fetishistic disorder; nor would an individual who prefers, and is not distressed or impaired by,
 solitary sexual behavior associated with wearing rubber garments or leather boots.
