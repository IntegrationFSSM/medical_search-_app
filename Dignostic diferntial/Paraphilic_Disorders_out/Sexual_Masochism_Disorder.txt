Differential Diagnosis
 Sexual masochism.
 Individuals with sexual masochism experience recurrent, intense sexual
 arousal from the act of being humiliated, beaten, bound, or otherwise made to suffer. Unless the
 sexual urges, fantasies, or behaviors involving being humiliated or made to suffer are
 accompanied by clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other
 important areas of functioning, a diagnosis of sexual masochism disorder is not warranted.
