Differential Diagnosis
 Exhibitionism.
 Individuals with exhibitionism experience recurrent, intense sexual arousal from
 the act of exposing their genitals to an unsuspecting person. Unless the individual acts on these
 urges with an unsuspecting person (e.g., exposing his genitals to riders on a train) or unless there
 is accompanying clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other
 important areas of functioning, a diagnosis of exhibitionistic disorder is not warranted.
 Manic episode, major neurocognitive disorder, intellectual developmental disorder, personality
 change due to another medical condition, substance intoxication, and schizophrenia.
 Individuals with a major neurocognitive disorder, intellectual developmental disorder,
 personality change due to another medical condition, or schizophrenia, or who are in a manic
 episode or experiencing substance intoxication, may become sexually disinhibited or have
 impaired judgment or impulse control and engage in exhibitionistic behavior. Unless that
 behavior occurs at times other than in the context of one of these disorders, a diagnosis of
 exhibitionistic disorder should not be made.
 Conduct disorder and antisocial personality disorder.
 Conduct disorder in adolescents and antisocial
 personality disorder would be characterized by additional norm-breaking and antisocial
 behaviors, and the specific sexual interest in exposing the genitals will usually be lacking.
