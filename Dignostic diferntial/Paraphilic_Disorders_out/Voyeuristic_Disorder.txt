Differential Diagnosis
 Voyeurism. Individuals with voyeurism experience recurrent, intense sexual arousal from the act
 of observing an unsuspecting person who is naked, in the process of disrobing, or engaging in
 sexual activity. Unless the individual acts on these urges with an unsuspecting person (e.g.,
 surreptitiously peeping through a neighbor’s window) or unless there is accompanying clinically
 significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning,
 a diagnosis of voyeuristic disorder is not warranted.
 Manic episode, major neurocognitive disorder, intellectual developmental disorder, personality
 change due to another medical condition, substance intoxication, and schizophrenia. Individuals with a major neurocognitive disorder, intellectual developmental disorder,
 personality change due to another medical condition, or schizophrenia, or who are in a manic
 episode or experiencing substance intoxication, may become sexually disinhibited or have
 impaired judgment or impulse control and engage in voyeuristic behavior. Unless that behavior
 occurs at times other than in the context of one of these disorders, a diagnosis of voyeuristic
 disorder should not be made.
 Conduct disorder and antisocial personality disorder. Conduct disorder in adolescents and antisocial
 personality disorder would be characterized by additional norm-breaking and antisocial
 behaviors, and the specific sexual interest in secretly watching unsuspecting others who are
 naked or engaging in sexual activity will usually be lacking.
