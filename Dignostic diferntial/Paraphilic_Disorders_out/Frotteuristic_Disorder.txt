Differential Diagnosis
 Frotteurism.
 Individuals with frotteurism experience recurrent intense sexual arousal from the act
 of touching or rubbing against a nonconsenting person. Unless the individual acts on these urges
 with a nonconsenting person (e.g., rubbing his genitals against a passenger on a crowded subway
 car) or unless there is accompanying clinically significant distress or impairment in social,
 occupational, or other important areas of functioning, a diagnosis of frotteuristic disorder is not
 warranted.
 Manic episode, major neurocognitive disorder, intellectual developmental disorder, personality
 change due to another medical condition, substance intoxication, and schizophrenia.
 Individuals with a major neurocognitive disorder, intellectual developmental disorder,
 personality change due to another medical condition, or schizophrenia, or who are in a manic
 episode or experiencing substance intoxication, may become sexually disinhibited or have
 impaired judgment or impulse control and engage in frotteuris-tic behavior. Unless that behavior
 occurs at times other than in the context of one of these disorders, a diagnosis of frotteuristic
 disorder should not be made.
 Conduct disorder and antisocial personality disorder.
 Conduct disorder in adolescents and antisocial
 personality disorder would be characterized by additional norm-breaking and antisocial
 behaviors, and the specific sexual interest in touching or rubbing against a nonconsenting person
 will usually be lacking.
