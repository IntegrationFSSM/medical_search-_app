Differential Diagnosis
 Nonsexual mental disorders.
 If the orgasm difficulties are better explained by another mental
 disorder, such as major depression, then a diagnosis of female orgasmic disorder would not be
 made.
Substance/medication-induced sexual dysfunction.
 Another medical condition.
 Interpersonal factors.
 Other sexual dysfunctions.
 F52.22
 An onset of orgasmic dysfunction that coincides
 with the beginning of substance/medication use and that dissipates with discontinuation of the
 substance/medication or dose reduction is suggestive of a substance/medication-induced sexual
 dysfunction, which should be diagnosed instead of female orgasmic disorder.
 If the disorder is attributable to another medical condition (e.g.,
 multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury), then a diagnosis of female orgasmic disorder would not be
 made.
 If interpersonal or significant contextual factors, such as severe relationship
 distress, intimate partner violence, or other significant stressors, are associated with the orgasm
 difficulties, then a diagnosis of female orgasmic disorder would not be made.
 Female orgasmic disorder may occur in association with other sexual
 dysfunctions (e.g., female sexual interest/arousal disorder). The presence of another sexual
 dysfunction does not rule out a diagnosis of female orgasmic disorder. Occasional orgasm
 difficulties that are short-term or infrequent and are not accompanied by clinically significant
 distress or impairment are not diagnosed as female orgasmic disorder. A diagnosis is also not
 appropriate if the problems are the result of inadequate sexual stimulation.
