 differentiating between a delayed ejaculation that is fully explained by another medical condition
 or injury (or its treatment) and a delayed ejaculation attributable to a variety of proportionally
 different biomedical-psychosocial and cultural factors that determine the symptom(s). A number
 of medical conditions or injuries, along with their treatments, may produce delays in ejaculation
 independent of psychosocial and cultural issues.
 Delayed ejaculation must be differentiated from a number of urological conditions
 (especially other ejaculatory disorders), including retrograde ejaculation or anejaculation, which
 is typically the result of etiologies ranging from hormonal to neurological and/or anatomical
 abnormalities, including ejaculatory duct obstruction and other urological disorders.
 A number of pharmacological agents, such as antidepressants,
 antipsychotics, α sympathetic drugs, alcohol, and opioid drugs, can cause ejaculatory problems.
 In such cases, the diagnosis is substance/medication-induced sexual dysfunction instead of
 delayed ejaculation.
 It is important in the history to ascertain whether the complaint concerns
 delayed ejaculation or the sensation of orgasm, or both. Ejaculation occurs in the genitals,
 whereas the experience of orgasm is believed to be primarily subjective. Ejaculation and orgasm
 usually occur together but not always. For example, a male with a normal ejaculatory pattern
 may complain of decreased pleasure (i.e., anhedonic ejaculation). Such a complaint would not be
 coded as delayed ejaculation but could be coded as other specified sexual dysfunction or
 unspecified sexual dysfunction.
