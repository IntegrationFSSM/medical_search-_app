Differential Diagnosis
 Substance/medication-induced sexual dysfunction.
 When problems with premature (early)
 ejaculation are attributable exclusively to substance use, intoxication, or withdrawal,
Ejaculatory concerns that do not meet diagnostic criteria.
 substance/medication-induced sexual dysfunction should be diagnosed.
 It is necessary to identify males with normal
 ejaculatory latencies who desire longer ejaculatory latencies and males who have episodic
 premature (early) ejaculation (e.g., during the first sexual encounter with a new partner when a
 short ejaculatory latency may be common or normative). Neither of these situations would lead
 to a diagnosis of premature (early) ejaculation, even though these situations may be distressing to
 some males.
