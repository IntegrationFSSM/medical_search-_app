Differential Diagnosis
 Nonsexual mental disorders. Nonsexual mental disorders, such as major depressive disorder,
 which is characterized by “markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all,
 activities,” may explain the lack of sexual desire. If the lack of desire is better explained by
 another mental disorder, then a diagnosis of male hypoactive sexual desire disorder would not be
 made.
 Substance/medication use. An onset of male hypoactive sexual desire that coincides with the
 beginning of substance/medication use and that dissipates with discontinuation of the
 substance/medication or dose reduction is suggestive of a substance/medication-induced sexual
 dysfunction, which should be diagnosed instead of male hypoactive sexual desire disorder.
 Another medical condition. If the low/absent desire and deficient/absent erotic thoughts or
 fantasies are better explained by the effects of another medical condition (e.g., hypogonadism,
 diabetes mellitus, thyroid dysfunction, central nervous system disease), then a diagnosis of male
 hypoactive sexual desire disorder would not be made.
  Interpersonal factors. If interpersonal or significant contextual factors, such as severe relationship
 distress or other significant stressors, are associated with the loss of desire in the man, then a
 diagnosis of male hypoactive sexual desire disorder would not be made.
 Other sexual dysfunctions. The presence of another sexual dysfunction does not rule out a
 diagnosis of male hypoactive sexual desire disorder; there is some evidence that up to one-half of
 men with low sexual desire also have erectile difficulties, and slightly fewer may also have early
 ejaculation difficulties. If the man’s low desire is explained by self-identification as an asexual,
 then a diagnosis of male hypoactive sexual desire disorder is not made.
