Differential Diagnosis
 Non-substance/medication-induced sexual dysfunctions. Many mental disorders, such as depressive,
 bipolar, anxiety, and psychotic disorders, are associated with disturbances of sexual function.
 Thus, differentiating a substance/medication-induced sexual

 dysfunction from a manifestation of the underlying mental disorder can be quite difficult. The
 diagnosis is usually established if a close relationship between substance/medication initiation or
 discontinuation is observed. A clear diagnosis can be established if the problem occurs after
 substance/medication initiation, dissipates with substance/medication discontinuation, and recurs
 with introduction of the same agent. Most substance/medication-induced side effects occur
 shortly after initiation or discontinuation. Sexual side effects that only occur after chronic use of
 a substance/medication may be extremely difficult to diagnose with certainty.
