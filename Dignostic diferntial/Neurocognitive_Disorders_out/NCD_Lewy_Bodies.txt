Differential Diagnosis
 Major or mild neurocognitive disorder due to Parkinson’s disease.
 The distinction between NCDLB
 and NCD due to Parkinson’s disease is based on the timing and sequence of motor symptoms
 and cognitive symptoms. Consensus criteria for DLB separate NCDLB from NCD due to
 Parkinson’s disease by specifying that for dementia to be attributed to Parkinson’s disease, the
 Parkinson’s disease diagnosis is present for at least 1 year before cognitive decline has reached
 the level of major NCD, whereas for NCDLB, the cognitive symptoms may begin before, with,
 or in the absence of parkinsonism. By contrast, expert consensus criteria for Parkinson’s disease
 propose that if cognitive decline occurs prior to a motor diagnosis, the diagnosis of Parkinson’s
disease may still be made; therefore, a clinician may attribute the cognitive decline to the
 Parkinson’s disease and diagnose NCD due to Parkinson’s disease. Consequently, the clinician
 may choose to diagnose NCD due to Parkinson’s disease or NCDLB for individuals with major
 NCD that starts either before or within 12 months of Parkinson’s disease. In such circumstances,
 the clinician decides which diagnosis is more appropriate. If Parkinson’s disease has been
 diagnosed for at least 1 year prior to the onset of cognitive symptoms, then both expert criteria
 agree that NCD due to Parkinson’s disease would typically be the appropriate diagnosis. The
 timing and sequence of parkinsonism and mild NCD may be particularly difficult to determine,
 and unspecified NCD may need to be diagnosed until the order of clinical progression becomes
 evident.
