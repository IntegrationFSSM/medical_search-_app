Differential Diagnosis
 Other mental disorders and medical conditions.
 Mental disorders (e.g., major depressive disorder,
 anxiety disorders, PTSD, alcohol and other substance use disorders, sleep disturbances),
 prescribed medications (e.g., typical antipsychotics, benzodiazepines, drugs with anticholinergic
 properties, antiepileptic drugs), and other medical conditions may contribute to or account for
 cognitive impairments among individuals with TBI, and need to be considered in the differential
 diagnosis of major or mild NCD due to TBI.
 Factitious disorder and malingering.
 Alternative explanations for neurocognitive symptoms should
 be considered when the severity of neurocognitive symptoms and functional limitations are
 inconsistent with the cognitive outcomes expected after TBI—and particularly mild TBI—and
 when neuropsychological assessment reveals poor effort or is otherwise not valid for
 interpretation. In such circumstances, the possibility of factitious disorder or malingering
 (especially in situations in which there might be external incentives such as obtaining financial
 compensation) should be considered.
