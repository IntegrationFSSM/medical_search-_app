Differential Diagnosis
 Individuals with substance use disorders, substance intoxication, and substance withdrawal are at
 increased risk for other conditions that may independently, or through a compounding effect,
 result in neurocognitive disturbance. These include history of traumatic brain injury and
 infections that can accompany substance use disorder (e.g., HIV, hepatitis C virus, syphilis).
 Therefore, presence of substance/medication-induced major or mild NCD should be
 differentiated from NCDs arising outside the context of substance use, intoxication, and
 withdrawal, including these accompanying conditions (e.g., traumatic brain injury).
