Differential Diagnosis
 Psychotic disorders and bipolar and depressive disorders with psychotic features.
 Delirium 
that 
is
 characterized by vivid hallucinations, delusions, language disturbances, and agitation must be
 distinguished from brief psychotic disorder, schizophrenia,

 schizophreniform disorder, and other psychotic disorders, as well as from manic or major
 depressive episodes, with psychotic features.
 Acute stress disorder.
 Delirium associated with fear, anxiety, and dissociative symptoms, such as
 depersonalization, must be distinguished from acute stress disorder, which is precipitated by
 exposure to a severely traumatic event.
 Malingering and factitious disorder.
 Delirium can be distinguished from these disorders on the basis
 of the often atypical symptomatic presentation in malingering and factitious disorder and the
 absence of another medical condition or substance that is etiologically related to the apparent
 cognitive disturbance.
 Other neurocognitive disorders.
 The most common differential diagnostic issue when evaluating
 confusion in older adults is disentangling symptoms of delirium and major NCD. The clinician
 must determine whether the individual has delirium; a delirium superimposed on a preexisting
 NCD, such as that due to Alzheimer’s disease; or an NCD without delirium. The traditional
distinction between delirium and major NCD according to acuteness of onset and temporal
 course is particularly difficult in those elderly individuals who had a prior NCD that may not
 have been recognized, or who developed persistent cognitive impairment following an episode of
 delirium. When delirium and major NCD are comorbid, the management of the delirium should
 generally be given priority
