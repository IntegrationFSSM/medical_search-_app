Differential Diagnosis
 Other major or mild neurocognitive disorder. The presence of an attributable medical condition does
 not entirely exclude the possibility of another etiological type of major or mild NCD. If cognitive
deficits persist following successful treatment of an associated medical condition, then another
 etiology may be responsible for the cognitive decline.
