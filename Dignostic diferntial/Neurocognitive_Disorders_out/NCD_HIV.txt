Differential Diagnosis
 In the presence of comorbidities, such as other infections (e.g., hepatitis C virus, syphilis),
 substance use disorder (e.g., methamphetamine use disorder), prior traumatic brain injury, or
 neurodevelopmental conditions, major or mild NCD due to HIV infection can be diagnosed
provided there is evidence that infection with HIV has worsened any NCDs because of such
 preexisting or comorbid conditions. Among older adults, onset of neurocognitive decline related
 to cerebrovascular disease or primary neurodegeneration (e.g., major or mild NCD due to
 Alzheimer’s disease) may need to be differentiated; these conditions may be suggested by a
 relatively more progressive course of decline than is seen in NCD due to HIV. HIV infection
 itself has been shown to increase the risk of cerebrovascular disease. Because more severe
 immunodeficiency can result in opportunistic infections of the brain (e.g., toxoplasmosis;
 cryptococcosis) and neoplasia (e.g., CNS lymphoma), sudden
 721
 onset of an NCD or sudden worsening of an NCD demands active investigation of non-HIV
 etiologies. Delirium is important to consider because it occurs frequently over the disease course
 of individuals with HIV and may be due to multiple etiologies (including SARS-CoV-2 co
infection).
