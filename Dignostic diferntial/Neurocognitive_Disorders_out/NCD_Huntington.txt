Differential Diagnosis
Other mental disorders.
 Other neurocognitive disorders.
 Other movement disorders.
 Early symptoms of Huntington’s disease may include instability of mood,
 irritability, or compulsive behaviors that may suggest another mental disorder. However, genetic
 testing or the development of motor symptoms will distinguish the presence of Huntington’s
 disease. In such cases, if the mood symptoms are a focus of clinical attention, they may be
 indicated by an additional diagnosis of depressive disorder due to Huntington’s disease, with
 depressive features.
 The early symptoms of Huntington’s disease, particularly
 symptoms of executive dysfunction and impaired psychomotor speed, may resemble other
 neurocognitive disorders (NCDs), such as major or mild vascular NCD.
 Huntington’s disease must also be differentiated from other disorders
 or conditions associated with chorea, such as Wilson’s disease, drug-induced tardive dyskinesia,
 Sydenham’s chorea, systemic lupus erythematosus, or senile chorea. Rarely, individuals may
 present with a course similar to that of Huntington’s disease but without positive genetic testing;
 this is considered to be a Huntington’s disease phenocopy that results from a variety of potential
 genetic factors.
