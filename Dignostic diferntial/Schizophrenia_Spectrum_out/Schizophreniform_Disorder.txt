Differential Diagnosis, and Comorbidity, see the corresponding
 sections in Schizophrenia.


Differential Diagnosis
 Other mental disorders and medical conditions. A wide variety of mental disorders and medical
 conditions can manifest with psychotic symptoms that must be considered in the differential
 diagnosis of schizophreniform disorder. These include psychotic disorder due to another medical
 condition or its treatment; delirium or major neurocognitive disorder; substance/medication
induced psychotic disorder or delirium; major depressive or bipolar disorder with psychotic
 features; schizoaffective disorder; other specified or unspecified bipolar and related disorder;
 major depressive or bipolar disorder with catatonic features; schizophrenia; delusional disorder;
 other specified or unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder; schizotypal,
 schizoid, or paranoid personality disorders; autism spectrum disorder; disorders presenting in
 childhood with disorganized speech; attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder; obsessive
compulsive disorder; posttraumatic stress disorder; and traumatic brain injury.
 Since the diagnostic criteria for schizophreniform disorder and schizophrenia differ primarily
 in duration of illness, the discussion of the differential diagnosis of schizophrenia also applies to
 schizophreniform disorder.
  Brief psychotic disorder. Schizophreniform disorder differs in duration from brief psychotic
 disorder, which has a duration of less than 1 month.
