 Catatonia Associated With Another Mental Disorder
 (Catatonia Specifier)
 F06.1
 A. The clinical picture is dominated by three (or more) of the following symptoms:
 1. Stupor (i.e., no psychomotor activity; not actively relating to environment).
 2. Catalepsy (i.e., passive induction of a posture held against gravity).
 3. Waxy flexibility (i.e., slight, even resistance to positioning by examiner).
 4. Mutism (i.e., no, or very little, verbal response [exclude if known aphasia]).
 5. Negativism (i.e., opposition or no response to instructions or external stimuli).
 6. Posturing (i.e., spontaneous and active maintenance of a posture against
 gravity).
 7. Mannerism (i.e., odd, circumstantial caricature of normal actions).
 8. Stereotypy (i.e., repetitive, abnormally frequent, non-goal-directed
 movements).
 9. Agitation, not influenced by external stimuli.
 10. Grimacing.
 11. Echolalia (i.e., mimicking another’s speech).
 12. Echopraxia (i.e., mimicking another’s movements).
 Coding note: Indicate the name of the associated mental disorder when recording
 the name of the condition (i.e., F06.1 catatonia associated with major depressive
 disorder). Code first the associated mental disorder (e.g., neurodevelopmental
 disorder, brief psychotic disorder, schizophreniform disorder, schizophrenia,
 schizoaffective disorder, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, or other mental
 disorder) (e.g., F25.1 schizoaffective disorder, depressive type; F06.1 catatonia
 associated with schizoaffective disorder).
