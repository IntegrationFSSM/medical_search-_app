Differential Diagnosis
 A separate diagnosis of catatonic disorder due to another medical condition is not given if the
 catatonia occurs exclusively during the course of a delirium or neuroleptic malignant syndrome.
 However, even though a separate diagnosis of catatonia cannot be made, research suggests that
 catatonia symptoms occur in a significant proportion of delirium cases. If the individual is
 currently taking neuroleptic medication, consideration should be given to medication-induced
 movement disorders (e.g., abnormal positioning may be due to neuroleptic-induced acute
 dystonia) or neuroleptic malignant syndrome (e.g., catatonic-like features may be present, along
 with associated vital sign and/or laboratory abnormalities). Catatonic symptoms may be present
 in any of the following five psychotic disorders: brief psychotic disorder, schizophreniform
 disorder, schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and substance/medication-induced psychotic
 disorder. It may also be present in some of the neurodevelopmental disorders, in all of the bipolar
 and depressive disorders, and in other mental disorders
