Differential Diagnosis
 Ordinary theft.
 Kleptomania should be distinguished from ordinary acts of theft or shoplifting.
 Ordinary theft (whether planned or impulsive) is deliberate and is motivated by the usefulness of
 the object or its monetary worth. Some persons, especially adolescents, may also steal on a dare,
 as an act of rebellion, or as a rite of passage. The diagnosis is not made unless other
 characteristic features of kleptomania are also present. Kleptomania is rare, whereas shoplifting
 is relatively common.

 In malingering, individuals may simulate the symptoms of kleptomania to avoid
 criminal prosecution.
