Differential Diagnosis
 Other causes of intentional fire setting.
 It is important to rule out other causes of fire setting before
 giving the diagnosis of pyromania. Intentional fire setting may occur for profit, sabotage, or
 revenge; to conceal a crime; to make a political statement (e.g., an act of terrorism or protest); or
 to attract attention or recognition (e.g., setting a fire in order to discover it and save the day). Fire
 setting may also occur as part of developmental experimentation in childhood (e.g., playing with
 matches, lighters, or fire).
 Other mental disorders.
 A separate diagnosis of pyromania is not given when fire setting occurs as
 part of conduct disorder, a manic episode, or antisocial personality disorder, or if it occurs in
 response to a delusion or a hallucination (e.g., in schizophrenia) or is attributable to the
 physiological effects of another medical condition (e.g., epilepsy). The diagnosis of pyromania
 should also not be given when fire setting results from impaired judgment associated with major
 neurocognitive disorder, intellectual developmental disorder, or substance intoxication.
