Differential Diagnosis
 Silent period in immigrant children learning a second language.
 Selective 
mutism 
must 
be
 distinguished from the typical “silent period” associated with the acquisition of a new language
 in young children. If comprehension of the new language is adequate but refusal to speak persists
 in both languages, in several unfamiliar settings, and for a prolonged period, a diagnosis of
 selective mutism may be warranted.
 Communication disorders.
 Selective mutism should be distinguished from speech disturbances
 that are better explained by a communication disorder, such as language disorder, speech sound
 disorder (previously phonological disorder), childhood-onset

 fluency disorder (stuttering), or social (pragmatic) communication disorder. Unlike selective
 mutism, the speech disturbance in these conditions is not restricted to a specific social situation.

 autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia or another psychotic disorder, or severe intellectual
 developmental disorder (intellectual disability) may have problems in social communication and
 be unable to speak appropriately in social situations. In contrast, selective mutism should be
 diagnosed only when a child has an established capacity to speak in some social situations (e.g.,
 typically at home).
 Social anxiety disorder.
 The social anxiety and social avoidance in social anxiety disorder may be
 associated with selective mutism. In such cases, both diagnoses may be given.
