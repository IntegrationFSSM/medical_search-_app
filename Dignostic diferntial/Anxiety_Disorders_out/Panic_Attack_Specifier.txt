Differential Diagnosis
 Other paroxysmal episodes (e.g., “anger attacks”).
 Panic attacks should not be diagnosed if the
 episodes do not involve the essential feature of an abrupt surge of intense fear or intense
 discomfort, but rather other emotional states (e.g., anger, grief).
 Anxiety disorder due to another medical condition.
 misdiagnosed 
as 
panic 
attacks 
Medical conditions that can cause or be
 include 
hyperthyroidism, 
hyperparathyroidism,
 pheochromocytoma, vestibular dysfunctions, seizure disorders, and cardiopulmonary conditions
 (e.g., arrhythmias, supraventricular tachycardia, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease).
 Appropriate laboratory tests (e.g., serum calcium levels for hyperparathyroidism; Holter monitor
 for arrhythmias) or physical examinations (e.g., for cardiac conditions) may be helpful in
 determining the etiological role of another medical condition.
Substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder.
 Panic disorder.

 Intoxication with central nervous system stimulants
 (e.g., cocaine, amphetamine-type substances, caffeine) or cannabis and withdrawal from central
 nervous system depressants (e.g., alcohol, barbiturates) can precipitate a panic attack. A detailed
 history should be taken to determine if the individual had panic attacks prior to excessive
 substance use. Features such as onset after age 45 years or the presence of atypical symptoms
 during a panic attack (e.g., vertigo, loss of consciousness, loss of bladder or bowel control,
 slurred speech, or amnesia) suggest the possibility that a medical condition or a substance may
 be causing the panic attack symptoms.
 Repeated unexpected panic attacks are required but are not sufficient for the
 diagnosis of panic disorder (i.e., full diagnostic criteria for panic disorder must be met).
