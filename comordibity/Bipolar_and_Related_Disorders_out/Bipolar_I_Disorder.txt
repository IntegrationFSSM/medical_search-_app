Comorbidity
 Co-occurring mental disorders are the norm in bipolar I disorder, with the majority of individuals
 having a history of three or more disorders. The most frequently comorbid disorders are anxiety
 disorders, alcohol use disorder, other substance use disorder, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity
 disorder. Sociocultural factors influence the pattern of comorbid conditions in bipolar disorder.
 For example, countries with cultural prohibitions against alcohol or other substance use may
 have a lower prevalence of substance use comorbidity. Bipolar I disorder is frequently associated
 with borderline, schizotypal, and antisocial personality disorder. In particular, although the
 underlying nature of the relationship between bipolar I disorder and borderline personality
 disorder is unclear, the substantial comorbidity between the two may reflect similarities in
 phenomenology (i.e., misdiagnosing the emotional extremes of borderline personality disorder as
 bipolar I disorder), the influence of borderline personality features on vulnerability to bipolar I
 disorder, and the impact of early childhood adversity on the development of both bipolar I and
 borderline personality disorder.
 Individuals with bipolar I disorder also have high rates of serious co-occurring and often
 untreated medical conditions, which largely explain the shortened life expectancy of those with
 bipolar disorder. Comorbidities appear in multiple organ systems, with cardiovascular and
 autoimmune diseases, obstructive sleep apnea, metabolic syndrome, and migraine more common
 among individuals with bipolar disorder than in the general population. Comorbid
 overweight/obesity is a particular concern for individuals with bipolar disorder and is associated
 with poor treatment outcomes
