Comorbidity
 Rates of comorbidity with substance-related disorders are high in schizophrenia. Over half of
 individuals with schizophrenia have tobacco use disorder and smoke cigarettes regularly.
 Comorbidity with anxiety disorders is increasingly recognized in schizophrenia. Rates of
 obsessive-compulsive disorder and panic disorder are elevated in individuals with schizophrenia
 compared with the general population. Schizotypal or paranoid personality disorder may
 sometimes precede the onset of schizophrenia.
 Life expectancy is reduced in individuals with schizophrenia because of associated medical
 conditions. Weight gain, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular and pulmonary
 disease are more common in schizophrenia than in the general population. Poor engagement in
 health maintenance behaviors (e.g., cancer screening, exercise) increases the risk of chronic
 disease, but other disorder factors, including medications, lifestyle, cigarette smoking, and diet,
 may also play a role. A shared vulnerability for psychosis and medical conditions may explain
 some of the medical comorbidity of schizophrenia.
