 Comorbidity
 Women with female orgasmic disorder may have co-occurring sexual interest/arousal
 difficulties. Women with diagnoses of other nonsexual mental disorders, such as major
 depressive disorder, may experience lower sexual interest/arousal, and this may indirectly
 increase the likelihood of orgasm difficulties.
