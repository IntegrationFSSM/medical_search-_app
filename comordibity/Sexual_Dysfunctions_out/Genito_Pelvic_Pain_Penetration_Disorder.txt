 Comorbidity
 Comorbidity between genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder and other sexual difficulties
 appears to be common. Comorbidity with relationship distress is also common and typically
 related to the lack of sexual intimacy rather than (solely) the pain itself. This is not surprising,
 because the inability to have (pain-free) intercourse with a desired partner and the avoidance of
 sexual opportunities may be either a contributing factor to or the result of other sexual or
 relationship problems. Because pelvic floor symptoms are implicated in the diagnosis of genito
pelvic pain/penetration disorder, there is likely to be a higher prevalence of other disorders
 related to the pelvic floor or reproductive organs (e.g., interstitial cystitis, constipation, vaginal
 infection, endometriosis, irritable bowel syndrome). Females with genito-pelvic pain/penetration
 disorder frequently experience comorbid chronic pain conditions (e.g., fibromyalgia, chronic
 headaches), and the prevalence of these comorbidities increases with the severity of vulvar pain
 symptoms.
 Lesbian women also report genito-pelvic pain and penetration difficulties during sexual
 activities; the frequency of genito-pelvic pain/penetration symptoms among nonheterosexual
 women has been shown to be less than or the same as among heterosexual women.
