Comorbidity
 Male hypoactive sexual desire disorder is rarely the sole sexual diagnosis in men. Erectile
 dysfunction, delayed ejaculation, and premature (early) ejaculation are often comorbid
 diagnoses. Depression and other mental disorders, as well as endocrinological factors, are often
 comorbid with male hypoactive sexual desire disorder.
