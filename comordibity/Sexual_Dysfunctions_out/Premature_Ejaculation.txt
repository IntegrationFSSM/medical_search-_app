 Comorbidity
 Premature (early) ejaculation may be associated with erectile problems. In many cases, it may be
 difficult to determine which difficulty preceded the other. Lifelong premature (early) ejaculation
 may be associated with certain anxiety disorders. Acquired premature (early) ejaculation may be
 associated with prostatitis, thyroid disease, or drug withdrawal (e.g., during opioid withdrawal)
