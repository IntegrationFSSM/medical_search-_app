 ejaculation and male hypoactive sexual desire disorder, as well as with anxiety and depressive
 disorders. The risk of depression is significantly higher in males with erectile disorder, with a
 markedly higher risk of depression in the first year after onset. In males diagnosed with
 posttraumatic stress disorder, erectile problems are common. Erectile disorder is common in
 males with lower urinary tract symptoms related to prostatic hypertrophy. Erectile disorder may
 be comorbid with dyslipidemia, cardiovascular disease, hypogonadism, multiple sclerosis,
 diabetes mellitus, and other diseases that interfere with the vascular, neurological, or endocrine
 function necessary for normal erectile function.
