Comorbidity
 Gambling disorder is associated with poor general health. In addition, some specific medical
 conditions, such as tachycardia and angina, are more common among individuals with gambling
 disorder than in the general population, even when other substance use disorders, including
 tobacco use disorder, are controlled for. In U.S. national surveys, individuals with gambling
 disorder have high rates of comorbidity with other mental disorders, such as substance use
 disorders, depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, and personality disorders. In some individuals,
 other mental disorders may precede gambling disorder and be either absent or present during the
 manifestation of gambling disorder. Gambling disorder may also occur prior to the onset of other
 mental disorders, especially bipolar and related disorders, anxiety disorders, and substance use
 disorders. In a U.S. national survey, in approximately three-quarters of cases of individuals with
 gambling disorder and another mental disorder, other psychopathology preceded the gambling
 disorder
