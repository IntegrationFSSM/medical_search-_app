Comorbidity
 Nonmedical use of sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic agents is associated with alcohol use
 disorder, tobacco use disorder, and, generally, illicit drug use. There may also be an overlap
 between sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder and antisocial personality disorder;
 depressive, bipolar, and anxiety disorders; and other substance use disorders, such as alcohol use
 disorder and illicit drug use disorders. Antisocial behavior and antisocial personality disorder are
 especially associated with sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder when the substances are
 obtained illegally. Comorbidity with other substance use disorders and other psychiatric
 disorders increases the risk of transition from sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use to use disorder
 and decreases the probability of remission.
