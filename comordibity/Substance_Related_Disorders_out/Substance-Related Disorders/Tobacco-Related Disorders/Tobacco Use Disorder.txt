 Comorbidity
 The most common medical conditions from smoking are cardiovascular illnesses, chronic
 obstructive pulmonary disease, and cancers. Smoking also increases perinatal problems, such as
 low birth weight and miscarriage. Prevalence of smoking is almost twice as high in individuals
 with major depressive disorder; although the prevalence of smoking in the United States is
 higher among individuals with low socioeconomic status, the increased prevalence of smoking
 among those with depression is independent of socioeconomic status. The most common
 psychiatric comorbidities associated with smoking are alcohol and other substance, depressive,
 bipolar, anxiety, personality, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorders. In the United States,
 individuals with a psychiatric disorder are three times more likely than others to have tobacco
 use disorder. Adults with DSM-5 tobacco use disorder are significantly more likely than other
 adults to have comorbid psychiatric disorders, including other DSM-5 substance use disorders,
 major depressive disorder, bipolar I disorder, panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder,
 posttraumatic stress disorder, and borderline and antisocial personality disorders.
