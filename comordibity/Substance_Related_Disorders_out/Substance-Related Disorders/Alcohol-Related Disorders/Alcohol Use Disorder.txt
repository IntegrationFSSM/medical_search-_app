Comorbidity
 Bipolar disorders, schizophrenia, and antisocial personality disorder are associated with alcohol
use disorder, and most anxiety and depressive disorders are associated with alcohol use disorder
 as well. At least a part of the reported association between depression and moderate to severe
 alcohol use disorder may be attributable to temporary, alcohol-induced comorbid depressive
 symptoms resulting from the acute effects of intoxication or withdrawal, although this point has
 long been debated. Severe, repeated alcohol intoxication may also suppress immune mechanisms
 and predispose individuals to infections and increase the risk for cancers.
