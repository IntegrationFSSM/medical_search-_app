Comorbidity
 Alcohol intoxication may occur comorbidly with other substance intoxication, especially in
 individuals with conduct disorder or antisocial personality disorder. Given the typical overlap of
 alcohol intoxication with alcohol use disorder, see “Comorbidity” under Alcohol Use Disorder
 for more details about co-occurring conditions that are likely to be encountered.
