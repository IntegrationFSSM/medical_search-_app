 Comorbidity
 Other than overdose, the most common medical comorbidities associated with opioid use
 disorder are viral (e.g., HIV, hepatitis C virus) and bacterial infections, particularly among
 injection heroin users. These infections are less common in prescription opioid use disorder.
 Research with nationally representative samples of the U.S. population has found that opioid
 use disorder is often associated with other substance use disorders, especially those involving
 tobacco, alcohol, cannabis, stimulants, and benzodiazepines. Individuals with opioid use disorder
 are at risk for the development of persistent depressive disorder or major depressive disorder.
 These symptoms may represent an opioid-induced depressive disorder or an exacerbation of a
 preexisting independent depressive disorder. Periods of depression are especially common
 during chronic intoxication or in association with physical or psychosocial stressors related to the
 opioid use disorder. Insomnia is also common, especially during withdrawal. Opioid use disorder
 is also associated with bipolar I disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and antisocial, borderline,
and schizotypal personality disorders. A history of conduct disorder in childhood or adolescence
 has also been identified as a significant risk factor for substance-related disorders, especially
 opioid use disorder. Further, prescription opioid use disorder and heroin use disorder are
 generally associated with serious mental illness, defined as a mental disorder other than a
 substance use disorder that results in serious functional impairment substantially limiting or
 interfering with major life activities.
