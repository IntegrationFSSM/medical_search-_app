Comorbidity
 Typical dietary doses of caffeine have not been consistently associated with medical problems.
 However, heavy use (e.g., > 400 mg) can cause or exacerbate anxiety and somatic symptoms and
 gastrointestinal distress. With acute, extremely high doses of caffeine, grand mal seizures and
 respiratory failure may result in death. Excessive caffeine use is associated with depressive
 disorders, bipolar disorders, eating disorders, psychotic disorders, sleep disorders, and substance
related disorders, whereas individuals with anxiety disorders are more likely to avoid caffeine.
