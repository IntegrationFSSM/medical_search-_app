Comorbidity
 Stimulant-related disorders often co-occur with other substance use disorders, especially those
 involving substances with sedative properties, which are often taken to reduce insomnia,
 nervousness, and other unpleasant side effects. Individuals admitted to treatment for cocaine use
 are likely to also use heroin, PCP, or alcohol, and individuals admitted for amphetamine-type
 substance use disorder are likely to use marijuana, heroin, or alcohol. Stimulant use disorder may
 be associated with posttraumatic stress disorder, antisocial personality disorder, attention
deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and gambling disorder. Cardiopulmonary problems are often
 present in individuals seeking treatment for cocaine-related problems, with chest pain being the
 most common. Medical problems occur in response to adulterants used as “cutting” agents.
 Cocaine users who ingest cocaine cut with levamisole, an antimicrobial and veterinary
 medication, may experience agranulocytosis and febrile neutropenia.
