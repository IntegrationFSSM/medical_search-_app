Comorbidity
 Rates of comorbidity in disruptive mood dysregulation disorder are extremely high. It is rare to
 find individuals whose symptoms meet criteria for disruptive mood dysregulation disorder alone.
 Comorbidity between disruptive mood dysregulation disorder and other DSM-defined
 syndromes appears higher than for many other pediatric mental illnesses; the strongest overlap is
 with oppositional defiant disorder. Not only is the overall rate of comorbidity high in disruptive
 mood dysregulation disorder, but also the range of comorbid illnesses appears particularly
 diverse. These children typically present to the clinic with a wide range of disruptive behavior,
 mood, anxiety, and even autism spectrum symptoms and diagnoses. However, children with
disruptive mood dysregulation disorder should not have symptoms that meet criteria for bipolar
 disorder, as in that context, only the bipolar disorder diagnosis should be made. If children have
 symptoms that meet criteria for oppositional defiant disorder or intermittent explosive disorder
 and disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, only the diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation
 disorder should be assigned. Also, as noted earlier, the diagnosis of disruptive mood
 dysregulation disorder should not be assigned if the symptoms occur only in an anxiety
provoking context, when the routines of a child with autism spectrum disorder or obsessive
compulsive disorder are disturbed, or in the context of a major depressive episode.
