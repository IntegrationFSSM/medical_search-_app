 Comorbidity
 In comparison to individuals with major depressive disorder, those with persistent depressive
 disorder are at higher risk for psychiatric comorbidity in general, and for anxiety disorders,
 substance use disorders, and personality disorders in particular. Early-onset persistent depressive
 disorder is strongly associated with DSM-5 Cluster B and C personality disorders.
