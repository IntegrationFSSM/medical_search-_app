Comorbidity
 A major depressive episode is the most frequently reported previous disorder in individuals
 presenting with premenstrual dysphoric disorder. A wide range of medical conditions (e.g.,
 migraine, asthma, allergies, seizure disorders) or other mental disorders (e.g., depressive and
 bipolar disorders, anxiety disorders, bulimia nervosa, substance use disorders) may worsen in the
premenstrual phase; however, the absence of a symptom-free period during the postmenstrual
 interval obviates a diagnosis of premenstrual dysphoric disorder. These conditions are better
 considered premenstrual exacerbation of a current mental disorder or medical condition.
 Although the diagnosis of premenstrual dysphoric disorder should not be assigned in situations
 in which an individual experiences only a premenstrual exacerbation of another mental or
 physical disorder, it can be considered in addition to the diagnosis of another mental disorder or
 medical condition if the individual experiences symptoms and changes in level of functioning
 that are characteristic of premenstrual dysphoric disorder and markedly different from the
 symptoms experienced as part of the ongoing disorder.
