Comorbidity
 In one study using DSM-IV, comparing individuals with independent major depressive disorder
 and no comorbid substance use disorder and individuals with substance/medication-induced
 depressive disorder, those with substance/medication-induced depressive disorder had higher
 rates of comorbidity with any DSM-IV mental disorder; were more likely to have specific
 disorders of tobacco use disorder, gambling disorder, and antisocial personality disorder; and
 were less likely to have persistent depressive disorder. Compared with individuals with major
 depressive disorder and a comorbid substance use disorder, individuals with
 substance/medication-induced depressive disorder are more likely to have alcohol or other
 substance use disorder; however, they are less likely to have persistent depressive disorder.
