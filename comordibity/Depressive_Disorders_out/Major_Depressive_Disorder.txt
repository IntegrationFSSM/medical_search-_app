Comorbidity
 Other disorders with which major depressive disorder frequently co-occurs are substance-related
 disorders, panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, obsessive
compulsive disorder, anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and borderline personality disorder.
 While women are more likely than men to report comorbid anxiety disorders, bulimia
 nervosa, and somatoform disorder (somatic symptom and related disorders), men are more likely
 to report comorbid alcohol and substance abuse.
