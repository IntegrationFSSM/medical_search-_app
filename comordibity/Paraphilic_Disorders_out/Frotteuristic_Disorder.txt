Comorbidity
 Known comorbidities in frotteuristic disorder are largely based on research with men suspected
 of or convicted for criminal acts involving sexually motivated touching of or

 rubbing against a nonconsenting person. Hence, these comorbidities might not apply to other
 individuals with a diagnosis of frotteuristic disorder based on subjective distress over their sexual
 interest. Conditions that occur comorbidly with frotteuristic disorder include hypersexuality and
 other paraphilic disorders, particularly exhibitionistic disorder and voyeuristic disorder. Conduct
 disorder, antisocial personality disorder, depressive disorders, bipolar disorders, anxiety
 disorders, and substance use disorders also co-occur.
