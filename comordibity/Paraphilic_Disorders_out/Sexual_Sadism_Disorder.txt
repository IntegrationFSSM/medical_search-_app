Comorbidity
 Known comorbidities with sexual sadism disorder are largely based on individuals (almost all
 men) convicted for criminal acts involving sadistic acts against nonconsenting victims. Hence,
 these comorbidities might not apply to all individuals who never engaged in sadistic activity with
 a nonconsenting victim but who qualify for a diagnosis of sexual sadism disorder based on
 subjective distress over their sexual interest. Disorders that are commonly comorbid with sexual
 sadism disorder include other paraphilic disorders. According to a population-based study in
 Finland, individuals who had engaged in sexually sadistic behavior had also engaged in other
 types of paraphilic behavior, namely (in descending order of co-occurrence) masochism (68.8%),
 voyeurism (33.3%), transvestic fetishism (9.2%), and exhibitionism (6.4%).
