 Comorbidity
 Psychiatric comorbidity of pedophilic disorder includes substance use disorders; depressive,
 bipolar, and anxiety disorders; antisocial personality disorder; and other paraphilic disorders.
 However, findings on comorbid disorders are largely among individuals convicted for sexual
 offenses involving children (almost all males) and may not be generalizable to other individuals
 with pedophilic disorder (e.g., individuals who have never approached a child sexually but who
 qualify for the diagnosis of pedophilic disorder on the basis of subjective distress)
