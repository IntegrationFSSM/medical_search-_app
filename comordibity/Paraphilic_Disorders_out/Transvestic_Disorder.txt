 Transvestic disorder is often found in association with other paraphilias. The most frequently co
occurring paraphilias are fetishistic sexual interests or behavior and masochistic sexual interests

 autoerotic asphyxia, is associated with transvestic sexual interests or behavior in a substantial
 proportion of fatal cases.
