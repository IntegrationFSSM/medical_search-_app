 Comorbidity
 Known comorbidities in exhibitionistic disorder are largely based on research with individuals
 (almost all men) convicted for criminal acts involving genital exposure to nonconsenting
 persons. Hence, these comorbidities might not apply to all individuals who qualify for a
diagnosis of exhibitionistic disorder. Conditions that occur comorbidly with exhibitionistic
 disorder at high rates include depressive, bipolar, anxiety, and substance use disorders;
 hypersexuality; attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder; other paraphilic disorders; and antisocial
 personality disorder.
