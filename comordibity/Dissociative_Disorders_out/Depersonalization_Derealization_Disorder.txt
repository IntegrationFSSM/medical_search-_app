 Comorbidity
 In a convenience sample of adults recruited for a number of depersonalization research studies,
 lifetime comorbidities were high for unipolar depressive disorder and for any anxiety disorder,
 with a significant proportion of the sample having both disorders. Comorbidity with
 posttraumatic stress disorder was low. The three most commonly co-occurring personality
 disorders were avoidant, borderline, and obsessive-compulsive.
