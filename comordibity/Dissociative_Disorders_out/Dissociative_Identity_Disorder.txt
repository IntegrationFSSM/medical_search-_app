Comorbidity
 Disorders that are comorbid with dissociative identity disorder include PTSD, depressive
 disorders, substance-related disorders, feeding and eating disorders, obsessive-compulsive
 disorder, antisocial personality disorder, and other specified personality disorder with avoidant,
 obsessive-compulsive, or borderline personality traits. The most common forms of functional
 neurological symptom disorder include nonepileptic seizures, gait disturbances, and paralyses.
 Most commonly, nonepileptic seizures resemble grand mal seizures or complex partial seizures
 with temporal lobe foci; others may mimic absence or partial seizures.
