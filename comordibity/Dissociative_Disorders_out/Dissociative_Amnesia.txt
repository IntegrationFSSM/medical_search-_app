 Comorbidity
 As is common in individuals with a history of trauma, many comorbidities co-occur with
 dissociative amnesia, particularly as dissociative amnesia begins to remit. A wide variety of
 affective phenomena may surface, including dysphoria, grief, rage, shame, guilt, and
 psychological conflict and turmoil. Individuals may engage in nonsuicidal self-injury and other
 high-risk behaviors. These individuals may have symptoms that meet diagnostic criteria for
 persistent depressive disorder, major depressive disorder, or subthreshold depression (other
 specified depressive disorder). Many individuals with dissociative amnesia develop PTSD at
 some point during their life, especially when the traumatic antecedents of their amnesia are
 brought into conscious awareness. Many of these individuals may show symptoms of the
 dissociative subtype of PTSD. Many individuals with dissociative amnesia have symptoms that
 meet diagnostic criteria for a comorbid somatic symptom and related disorder (and vice versa),
 particularly functional neurological symptom disorder (conversion disorder). Substance-related
 and addictive disorders may be comorbid with dissociative amnesia, as well as feeding and
 eating disorders and sexual dysfunctions. The most common comorbid personality disorder is
 other specified personality disorder (with mixed personality disorder features), which often
 includes avoidant, obsessive-compulsive, dependent, and borderline features.
