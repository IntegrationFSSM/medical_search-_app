 Comorbidity
 Although most children with enuresis do not have a comorbid mental disorder, the prevalence of
 comorbid behavioral and developmental symptoms is higher in children with both diurnal and
 nocturnal enuresis than in children without incontinence. Developmental delays, including
 speech, language, learning, and motor skills delays, are also present in a portion of children with
 enuresis. Encopresis and constipation are present in both day and night incontinence. Restless
 legs syndrome and parasomnias such as non–rapid eye movement sleep arousal disorders
(sleepwalking and sleep terror types) are associated with nocturnal enuresis. Additionally, there
 is a link between nocturnal enuresis and heavy snoring or sleep apneas. Approximately 50% of
 enuretic children with proven sleep-disordered breathing will become dry by undergoing
 adenotonsillectomy. Urinary tract infections are more common in children with daytime urinary
 incontinence and nonmonosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis, especially the diurnal subtype, than
 in those who are continent.
