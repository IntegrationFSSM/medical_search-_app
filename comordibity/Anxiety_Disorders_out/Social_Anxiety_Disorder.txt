 Social Anxiety Disorder
  Comorbidity
 Social anxiety disorder is often comorbid with other anxiety disorders, major depressive
 disorder, and substance use disorders, and the onset of social anxiety disorder generally precedes
 that of the other disorders, except for specific phobia and separation anxiety disorder. Chronic
 social isolation in the course of social anxiety disorder may result in major depressive disorder.
 Comorbidity with depression is high also in older adults. Substances may be used as self
medication for social fears, but the symptoms of substance intoxication or withdrawal, such as
 trembling, may also be a source of (further) social fear. Social anxiety disorder is frequently
 comorbid with body dysmorphic disorder, and generalized social anxiety disorder is often
 comorbid with avoidant personality disorder. In children, comorbidities with high-functioning
 autism spectrum disorder and selective mutism are common.
