 Comorbidity
 In children, separation anxiety disorder is highly comorbid with generalized anxiety disorder and
specific phobia. In adults, common comorbidities include specific phobia, PTSD, panic disorder,
 generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, agoraphobia, obsessive-compulsive
 disorder, prolonged grief disorder, and personality disorders. Among the personality disorders,
 dependent, avoidant, and obsessive-compulsive (Cluster C) personality disorders may be
 comorbid with separation anxiety disorder. Depressive and bipolar disorders are also comorbid
 with separation anxiety disorder in adults.
