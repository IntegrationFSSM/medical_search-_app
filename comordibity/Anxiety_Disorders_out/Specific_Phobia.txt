Specific Phobia
  Comorbidity
 Specific phobia is rarely seen in medical-clinical settings in the absence of other
 psychopathology and is more frequently seen in nonmedical mental health settings. Specific
 phobia is frequently associated with a range of other disorders. Because of early onset, specific
 phobia is typically the temporally primary disorder. Individuals with specific phobia are at
 increased risk for the development of other disorders, including other anxiety disorders,
 depressive and bipolar disorders, substance-related disorders, somatic symptom and related
 disorders, and personality disorders (particularly dependent personality disorder).
