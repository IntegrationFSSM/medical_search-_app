Panic Disorder
 Comorbidity
 Panic disorder infrequently occurs in clinical settings in the absence of other psychopathology. In
 the general population, 80% of individuals with panic disorder had a lifetime comorbid mental
 diagnosis. The prevalence of panic disorder is elevated in individuals with other disorders,
 particularly other anxiety disorders (and especially agoraphobia), major depressive disorder,
 bipolar I and bipolar II disorder, and possibly mild alcohol use disorder. While panic disorder
 occasionally has an earlier age at onset than the comorbid disorder(s), onset often occurs after the
 comorbid disorder and may be seen as a severity marker of the comorbid illness.
 Reported lifetime rates of comorbidity between major depressive disorder and panic disorder
 vary widely, ranging from 10% to 65% in individuals with panic disorder. In approximately one
third of individuals with both disorders, the depression precedes the onset of panic disorder. In
 the remaining two-thirds, depression occurs coincident with or following the onset of panic
 disorder. A subset of individuals with panic disorder develop a

 substance-related disorder, which for some represents an attempt to treat their anxiety with
 alcohol or medications. Comorbidity with other anxiety disorders and illness anxiety disorder is
 also common.
 Panic disorder is significantly comorbid with numerous general medical symptoms and
 conditions, including, but not limited to, dizziness, cardiac arrhythmias, hyperthyroidism,
 asthma, COPD, and irritable bowel syndrome. However, the nature of the association (e.g., cause
 and effect) between panic disorder and these conditions remains unclear. Although mitral valve
 prolapse and thyroid disease are more common among individuals with panic disorder than in the
 general population, the increases in prevalence are not consistent.
