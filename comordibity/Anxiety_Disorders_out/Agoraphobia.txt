Agoraphobia
  Comorbidity
 About 90% of individuals with agoraphobia also have other mental disorders. The most frequent
 additional diagnoses are other anxiety disorders (e.g., specific phobias, panic disorder, social
 anxiety disorder), depressive disorders (major depressive disorder), PTSD, and alcohol use
 disorder. Whereas other anxiety disorders (e.g., separation anxiety disorder, specific phobias,
 panic disorder) frequently precede onset of agoraphobia, depressive disorders and substance use
 disorders typically occur secondary to agoraphobia. In some individuals, a substance use disorder
 precedes agoraphobia. Individuals with comorbid agoraphobia and major depressive disorder
 tend to have a more treatment-resistant course of agoraphobia relative to individuals with
 agoraphobia alone.
