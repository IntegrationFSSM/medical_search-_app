Generalized Anxiety Disorder
  Comorbidity
 Individuals whose presentation meets criteria for generalized anxiety disorder are likely to have
 met, or currently meet, criteria for other anxiety and unipolar depressive disorders. The negative
 affectivity (neuroticism) or emotional liability that underpins this pattern of comorbidity is
 associated with temperamental antecedents and genetic and environmental risk factors shared
 between these disorders, although independent pathways are also possible. Comorbidity with
 substance use, conduct, psychotic, neurodevelopmental, and neurocognitive disorders is less
 common.
