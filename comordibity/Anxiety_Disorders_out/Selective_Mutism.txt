Comorbidity
 The most common comorbid conditions are other anxiety disorders, most often social anxiety
disorder, followed by separation anxiety disorder and specific phobia. In clinical settings,
 selective mutism and autism spectrum disorder have also been noted as frequently co-occurring
 conditions. Oppositional behaviors can be observed in a substantial minority of children with
 selective mutism, although this oppositional behavior may be limited to situations requiring
 speech. Communication delays or disorders also may appear in some children with selective
 mutism
