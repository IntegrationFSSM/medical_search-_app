 Comorbidity
 Depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder, bulimia nervosa, binge
eating disorder, and substance use disorders are most commonly comorbid with intermittent
 explosive disorder in community samples. In addition, individuals with antisocial personality
 disorder or borderline personality disorder, and individuals with a history of disorders with
 disruptive behaviors (e.g., ADHD, conduct disorder, oppositional defiant disorder), are at greater
 risk for comorbid intermittent explosive disorder.
