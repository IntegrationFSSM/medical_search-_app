Comorbidity
 Rates of oppositional defiant disorder are much higher in samples of children, adolescents, and
 adults with ADHD, and this may be the result of shared temperamental risk factors. Also,
 oppositional defiant disorder often precedes conduct disorder, although this appears to be most
 common in children with the childhood-onset subtype. Individuals with oppositional defiant
 disorder are also at increased risk for anxiety disorders and major depressive disorder, and this
 seems largely attributable to the presence of the angry-irritable mood symptoms. Extremely high

 rates of comorbidity between disruptive mood dysregulation disorder and symptoms
 characteristic of oppositional defiant disorder have been reported, with most individuals with
 disruptive mood dysregulation disorder having symptoms that meet criteria for oppositional
 defiant disorder (such as showing argumentative/defiant symptoms); but because oppositional
 defiant disorder cannot be diagnosed if criteria are also met for disruptive mood dysregulation
 disorder, only disruptive mood dysregulation disorder would be diagnosed in such cases.
 Adolescents and adults with oppositional defiant disorder also show a higher rate of substance
 use disorders,

 although it is unclear if this association is independent of the comorbidity with conduct disorder
