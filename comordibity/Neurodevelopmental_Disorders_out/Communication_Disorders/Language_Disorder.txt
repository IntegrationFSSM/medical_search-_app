Comorbidity
 Language disorder may be associated with other neurodevelopmental disorders in terms of
 specific learning disorder (literacy and numeracy), intellectual developmental disorder, attention
deficit/hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorder, and developmental coordination
 disorder. It is also associated with social (pragmatic) communication disorder. In clinical
 samples, language disorder may co-occur with speech sound disorder, although data from a large
 population-based sample of 6-year-old children in the United States suggest comorbidity might
 be rare (1.3%). A positive family history of speech or language disorders is often present.
