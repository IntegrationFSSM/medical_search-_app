Comorbidity
 The different types of specific learning disorder commonly co-occur with one another (e.g.,
 specific learning disorder with impairment in mathematics and with impairment in reading) and
 with other neurodevelopmental disorders (e.g., ADHD, communication disorders, developmental
 coordination disorder, autism spectrum disorder) or other mental disorders (e.g., anxiety and
 depressive disorders) or behavioral problems. Notably, estimates of the comorbidity of math and
 reading difficulties vary depending on the tests used to define the math difficulty, likely because
 the same symptom (e.g., arithmetic problems) can be associated with different cognitive deficits
 (e.g., a deficit in language skills or a deficit in number processing). These comorbidities do not
 necessarily exclude the diagnosis of specific learning disorder but may make testing and
 differential diagnosis more difficult, because each of the co-occurring disorders independently
 interferes with the execution of activities of daily living, including learning. Thus, clinical
 judgment is required to attribute such impairment to learning difficulties. If there is an indication
 that another diagnosis could account for the difficulties learning keystone academic skills
 described in Criterion A, specific learning disorder should not be diagnosed.
