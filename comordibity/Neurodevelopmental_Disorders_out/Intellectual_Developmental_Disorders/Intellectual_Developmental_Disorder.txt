 Comorbidity
 Co-occurring neurodevelopmental and other mental and medical conditions are frequent in
 intellectual developmental disorder, with rates of some conditions (e.g., mental disorders,
 cerebral palsy, and epilepsy) three to four times higher than in the general population. The
 prognosis and outcome of co-occurring diagnoses may be influenced by the presence of
 intellectual developmental disorder. Assessment procedures may require modifications because
 of associated disorders, including communication disorders, autism spectrum disorder, and
 motor, sensory, or other disorders. Knowledgeable informants are essential for identifying
 symptoms such as irritability, mood dysregulation, aggression, eating problems, and sleep
 problems, and for assessing adaptive functioning in various community settings.
 The most common co-occurring neurodevelopmental and other mental disorders are
 attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder; depressive and bipolar disorders; anxiety disorders;
 autism spectrum disorder; stereotypic movement disorder (with or without self-injurious
 behavior); impulse-control disorders; and major neurocognitive disorder. Major depressive
 disorder may occur throughout the range of severity of intellectual developmental disorder. Self
injurious behavior requires prompt diagnostic attention and may warrant a separate diagnosis of
 stereotypic movement disorder. Individuals with intellectual developmental disorder, particularly
 those with more severe intellectual developmental disorder, may also exhibit aggression and
 disruptive behaviors, including harm of others or property destruction.

 Individuals with intellectual developmental disorder disproportionately have more health
 problems, including obesity, than the general population. Frequently they cannot verbalize
 physical symptoms they are experiencing. This may lead to health problems being undiagnosed
 and untreated.
