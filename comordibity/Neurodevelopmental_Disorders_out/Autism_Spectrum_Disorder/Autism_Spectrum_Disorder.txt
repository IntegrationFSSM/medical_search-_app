Comorbidity
 Autism spectrum disorder is frequently associated with intellectual developmental disorder and
 language disorder (i.e., an inability to comprehend and construct sentences with proper
 grammar). Specific learning difficulties (literacy and numeracy) are common, as is
 developmental coordination disorder.

 Psychiatric comorbidities also co-occur in autism spectrum disorder. About 70% of
 individuals with autism spectrum disorder may have one comorbid mental disorder, and 40%
 may have two or more comorbid mental disorders. Anxiety disorders, depression, and ADHD are
 particularly common. Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder is a fairly frequent presenting
 feature of autism spectrum disorder, and extreme and narrow food preferences may persist.
 Among individuals who are nonverbal or have language deficits, observable signs such as
 changes in sleep or eating and increases in challenging behavior should trigger an evaluation for
 anxiety or depression, as well as for potential pain or discomfort from undiagnosed medical or
 dental problems. Medical conditions commonly associated with autism spectrum disorder
include epilepsy and constipation.
