 Comorbidity
 Many medical and psychiatric conditions have been described as co-occurring with tic disorders,
 and ADHD, disruptive behavior, and OCD and related disorders are particularly
 98
 common. Children with ADHD may demonstrate disruptive behavior, social immaturity, and
 learning difficulties that may interfere with academic progress and interpersonal relationships
 and lead to greater impairment than that caused by a tic disorder. The obsessive-compulsive
 symptoms observed in tic disorders tend to have an earlier age at onset and often are
 characterized by a need for symmetry and exactness and/or forbidden or taboo thoughts (e.g.,
 aggressive, sexual, or religious obsessions and related compulsions). Individuals with tic
 disorders can also have other movement disorders (e.g., Sydenham’s chorea, stereotypic
 movement disorder) and other neurodevelopmental and psychiatric conditions, such as autism
 spectrum disorder and specific learning disorder. As noted earlier, teenagers and adults with a tic
 disorder are at increased risk for developing a mood, anxiety, or substance use disorder.
