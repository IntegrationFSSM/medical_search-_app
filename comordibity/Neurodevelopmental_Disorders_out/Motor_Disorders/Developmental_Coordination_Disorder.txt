 Comorbidity
 Disorders that commonly co-occur with developmental coordination disorder include
 communication disorders; specific learning disorder (especially reading and writing); problems
 of inattention, including ADHD (the most frequent coexisting condition, with about 50% co
occurrence); autism spectrum disorder; disruptive and emotional behavior problems; and joint
 hypermobility syndrome. Different clusters of co-occurrence may be present (e.g., a cluster with
 severe reading disorders, fine motor problems, and handwriting problems; another cluster with
 impaired movement control and motor planning). Presence of other disorders does not exclude
 developmental coordination disorder but may make testing more difficult and may independently
 interfere with the execution of activities of daily living, thus requiring examiner judgment in
 ascribing impairment to motor skills.
