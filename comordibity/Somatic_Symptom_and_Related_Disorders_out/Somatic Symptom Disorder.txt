 Comorbidity
 Somatic symptom disorder is associated with high rates of comorbidity with other mental
 disorders as well as general medical conditions. The most relevant co-occurring mental disorders
 are anxiety and depressive disorders, each of which occurs in up to 50% of cases of somatic
 symptom disorders and significantly contributes to overall functional impairment and poorer
 quality of life. Other mental disorders that have been found to co-occur with somatic symptom
 disorder are posttraumatic stress disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Other evidence
 indicates an association with sexual dysfunction in men.
 Elevated levels of the psychological features (Criterion B) of somatic symptom disorder have
 been found in several general medical conditions. When a concurrent general medical condition
 is present, the degree of impairment is more marked than would be expected from the physical
 illness alone. Moreover, somatization in medical illness has been shown to worsen disease and
 treatment outcomes, adherence, and quality of life and to increase health care utilization.
