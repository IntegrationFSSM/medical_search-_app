Comorbidity
 Illness anxiety disorder co-occurs with anxiety disorders (in particular, generalized anxiety
 disorder and panic disorder), OCD, and depressive disorders. Approximately two-thirds of
 individuals with illness anxiety disorder are likely to have at least one other comorbid major
 mental disorder. Individuals with illness anxiety disorder may have an elevated risk for
 personality disorders.
