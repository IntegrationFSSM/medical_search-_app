 Comorbidity
 Conditions associated with neglect, including cognitive delays, language delays, and
 stereotypies, often co-occur with reactive attachment disorder. Medical conditions, such as
 severe malnutrition, may accompany signs of the disorder. Internalizing symptoms also may co
occur with reactive attachment disorder. A relationship between reactive attachment disorder and
 externalizing behavior problems or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has been
 suggested but not clearly established.
