Comorbidity
 Conditions associated with neglect, including cognitive delays, language delays, and
 stereotypies, may co-occur with disinhibited social engagement disorder. Autism spectrum
 disorder may also co-occur. In younger children and in middle childhood, disinhibited social
 engagement disorder often co-occurs with ADHD and externalizing disorders; this co-occurrence
 has been proposed to relate to common impairments in cognitive inhibitory control.
