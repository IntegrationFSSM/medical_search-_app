 Comorbidity
 Adjustment disorders can accompany most mental disorders and any medical condition.
 Adjustment disorders can be diagnosed in addition to another mental disorder only if the latter
 does not explain the particular symptoms that occur in reaction to the stressor. For example, an
 individual may develop an adjustment disorder, with depressed mood, after losing a job and at
 the same time have a diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive disorder. Or, an individual may have a
 depressive or bipolar disorder and an adjustment disorder as long as the criteria for both are met.
 Adjustment disorders are common accompaniments of medical illness and may be the major
 psychological response to a medical condition.
