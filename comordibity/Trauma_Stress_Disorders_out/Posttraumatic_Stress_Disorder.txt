 Comorbidity
 Individuals with PTSD are more likely than those without PTSD to have symptoms that meet
 diagnostic criteria for at least one other mental disorder, such as depressive, bipolar, anxiety, or
 substance use disorders. PTSD is also associated with increased risk of major neurocognitive
 disorder. In a U.S.-based study, women were more likely to develop PTSD following a mild TBI.
 Although most young children with PTSD also have at least one other diagnosis, the patterns of
 comorbidity are different than in adults, with oppositional defiant disorder and separation anxiety
 disorder predominating.
