 Comorbidity
 Excoriation disorder is often accompanied by other mental disorders. Such disorders include
 OCD and trichotillomania (hair-pulling disorder), as well as major depressive disorder.
 Depression comorbidity seems to be more common in women. Repetitive body-focused
 symptoms other than skin picking and hair pulling (e.g., nail biting) occur in many individuals
 with excoriation disorder and may deserve an additional diagnosis of other specified obsessive
compulsive and related disorder (i.e., other body-focused repetitive behavior disorder).
