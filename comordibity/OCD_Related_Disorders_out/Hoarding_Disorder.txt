 Comorbidity
 Approximately 75% of individuals with hoarding disorder have a comorbid mood or anxiety
 disorder. The most common comorbid conditions are major depressive disorder (30%–50%),
 social anxiety disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder. Approximately 20% of individuals
 with hoarding disorder also have symptoms that meet diagnostic criteria for OCD. These
 comorbidities may often be the main reason for consultation, because individuals are unlikely to
 spontaneously report hoarding symptoms, and hoarding symptoms are often not asked about in
 routine clinical interviews.
