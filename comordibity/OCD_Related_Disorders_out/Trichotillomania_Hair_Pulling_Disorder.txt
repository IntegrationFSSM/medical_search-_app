 Comorbidity
 Trichotillomania is often accompanied by other mental disorders, most commonly major
 depressive disorder and excoriation (skin-picking) disorder. Repetitive body-focused symptoms
 other than hair pulling or skin picking (e.g., nail biting) occur in the majority of individuals with
 trichotillomania and may deserve an additional diagnosis of other specified obsessive
compulsive and related disorder (i.e., other body-focused repetitive behavior disorder).
