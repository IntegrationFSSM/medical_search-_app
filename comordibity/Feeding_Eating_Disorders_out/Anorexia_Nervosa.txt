 Comorbidity
 Bipolar, depressive, and anxiety disorders commonly co-occur with anorexia nervosa. Many
F50.2
 individuals with anorexia nervosa report the presence of either an anxiety disorder or symptoms
 of anxiety prior to onset of their eating disorder. OCD is described in some individuals with
 anorexia nervosa, especially those with the restricting type. Alcohol use disorder and other
 substance use disorders may also be comorbid with anorexia nervosa, especially among those
 with the binge-eating/purging type.
