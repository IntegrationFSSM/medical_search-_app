 Comorbidity
 Binge-eating disorder is associated with significant psychiatric comorbidity that is comparable to
 that of bulimia nervosa and anorexia nervosa. The most common comorbid disorders are major
 depressive disorder and alcohol use disorder. The psychiatric comorbidity is linked to the
 severity of binge eating and not to the degree of obesity.
