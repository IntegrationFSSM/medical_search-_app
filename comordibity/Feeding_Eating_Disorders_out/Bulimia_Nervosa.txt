 Comorbidity
 Comorbidity with mental disorders is common in individuals with bulimia nervosa, with most
 experiencing at least one other mental disorder and many experiencing multiple comorbidities.
 Comorbidity is not limited to any particular subset but rather occurs across a wide range of
 mental disorders. There is an increased frequency of depressive symptoms (e.g., low self-esteem)
 and bipolar and depressive disorders (particularly depressive disorders) in individuals with

 bulimia nervosa. In many individuals, the mood disturbance begins at the same time as or
 following the development of bulimia nervosa, and individuals often ascribe their mood
 disturbances to the bulimia nervosa. However, in some individuals, the mood disturbance clearly
 precedes the development of bulimia nervosa. There may also be an increased frequency of
 anxiety symptoms (e.g., fear of social situations) or anxiety disorders. These mood and anxiety
 disturbances frequently remit following effective treatment of the bulimia nervosa. The lifetime
 prevalence of substance use disorder, particularly alcohol use disorder or stimulant use disorder,
 is at least 30% among individuals with bulimia nervosa. Stimulant use often begins in an attempt
 to control appetite and weight. A substantial percentage of individuals with bulimia nervosa also
 have personality features that meet criteria for one or more personality disorders, most frequently
 borderline personality disorder
