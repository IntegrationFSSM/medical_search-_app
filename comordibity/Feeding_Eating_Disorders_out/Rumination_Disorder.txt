Comorbidity
 Regurgitation with associated rumination can occur in the context of a concurrent medical
 condition or another mental disorder (e.g., generalized anxiety disorder). When the regurgitation
 occurs in this context, a diagnosis of rumination disorder is appropriate only when the severity of
 the disturbance exceeds that routinely associated with such conditions or disorders and warrants
 additional clinical attention.
