 Comorbidity
 Disorders most commonly comorbid with pica are autism spectrum disorder and intellectual
 developmental disorder (intellectual disability) and, to a lesser degree, schizophrenia and
 obsessive-compulsive disorder. Pica can be associated with trichotillomania (hair-pulling
 disorder) and excoriation (skin-picking) disorder. In comorbid presentations, the hair or skin is
 typically ingested. Pica can also be associated with avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder,
 particularly in individuals with a strong sensory component to their presentation. When an
 individual is known to have pica, assessment should include consideration of the possibility of
 gastrointestinal complications, poisoning, infection, and nutritional deficiency.
