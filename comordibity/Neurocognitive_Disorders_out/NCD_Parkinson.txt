 Comorbidity
 Parkinson’s disease may coexist with Alzheimer’s disease and cerebrovascular disease,
 especially in older individuals. Individuals with NCD due to Parkinson’s disease may display
 clinical or biomarker features that suggest the presence of both Parkinson’s disease and other
 pathologies. Evidence for mixed etiology does not preclude the contribution of Parkinson’s
 disease to an NCD. The compounding of multiple pathological features may diminish the
 functional abilities of individuals with Parkinson’s disease. Motor symptoms and frequent co
occurrence of depression, psychosis, REM sleep behavior disorder, or apathy can make
 functional impairment worse.
