Comorbidity
 Substance use disorders, substance intoxication, and substance withdrawal are highly comorbid
 with other mental disorders. In general, the higher the exposure to drugs of abuse, the greater the
 risk for a substance- or medication-induced NCD. Comorbid posttraumatic stress disorder,
 psychotic disorders, depressive and bipolar disorders, and neurodevelopmental disorders can
 contribute to neurocognitive impairment in substance users. Traumatic brain injury occurs more
 frequently with substance use, complicating efforts to determine the etiology of NCD in such
 cases. Severe, long-term alcohol use disorder can be associated with major organ system disease,
 including cerebrovascular disease and cirrhosis; inhalant use disorder is associated with higher
 rates of kidney and liver damage; and amphetamine- and cocaine-induced NCD may be
 accompanied by major or mild vascular NCD secondary to stimulant use.
