Comorbidity
 Major or mild NCD due to TBI may be accompanied by other specified or unspecified
 depressive or anxiety disorders characterized by disturbances in emotional function (e.g.,
 irritability, easy frustration, tension and anxiety, affective lability). Other specified or
 712
 unspecified personality disorders may also occur as a result of symptoms such as disinhibition,
 apathy, suspiciousness, or aggression. Medical comorbidities may occur with neurological and
 physical disturbances characterized by headache, fatigue, sleep disorders, vertigo or dizziness,
 tinnitus or hyperacusis, photosensitivity, anosmia, reduced tolerance to psychotropic
 medications, and, particularly in more severe TBI, neurological symptoms and signs (e.g.,
 seizures, hemiparesis, visual disturbances, cranial nerve deficits) and evidence of orthopedic
 injuries. The most common medical and psychiatric comorbidities associated with moderate-to
severe TBI are (in order of frequency) back pain, depression, hypertension, anxiety, fractures,
 high blood cholesterol, sleep disorders, panic attacks, osteoarthritis, and diabetes.
 Among individuals with substance use disorders, the neurocognitive effects of the substance
 contribute to or compound the TBI-associated cognitive disturbances, particularly among
 individuals with two or more TBIs.
 PTSD can co-occur with TBI in civilian, military, and veterans populations. TBI and PTSD
 produce similar neurocognitive symptoms (e.g., disturbances of complex attention, processing
 speed, learning and memory, and executive function), and either or both conditions, as well as
 co-occurring depression and sleep disturbances, may explain neurocognitive symptoms in
 individuals with such comorbidities.
