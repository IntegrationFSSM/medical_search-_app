Comorbidity
 Lewy body pathology frequently coexists with Alzheimer’s disease, transactive response DNA
binding protein 43 (TDP‐43)–related pathology, and cerebrovascular disease pathology,
 particularly in the oldest age groups. TDP-43 is a protein that has been identified as a source of
 the proteinopathies across a range of neurodegenerative disorders, including amyotrophic lateral
 sclerosis and frontotemporal degeneration. The presence of multiple pathological lesions has
 implications for disease prognosis and may be associated with a more rapid cognitive decline and
 shorter survival time.
