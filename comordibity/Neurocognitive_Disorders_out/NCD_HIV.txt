Comorbidity
 HIV disease is accompanied by chronic systemic and CNS inflammation and diseases that can be
 associated with an NCD. These complications can be part of the pathogenesis of major or mild
 NCD as well as ANI due to HIV infection. HIV frequently co-occurs with conditions such as
 substance use disorders and other sexually transmitted infections. Both medical and psychiatric
 comorbidities have been identified that increase the likelihood of a diagnosis of NCD due to HIV
 infection. Women and members of underserved ethnic and racialized groups may show variation
 in the rates of the comorbidities associated with NCD due to HIV infection.
