 Comorbidity
 Typically, sleepwalking in both children and adults is not associated with significant mental
 disorders. However, in adults, there is an association between sleepwalking and major depressive
 episodes and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Children or adults with sleep terrors may have
 elevated scores for depression and anxiety on personality inventories.
