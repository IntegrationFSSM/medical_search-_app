 Comorbidity
 Medical and psychiatric comorbidities are common among individuals with narcolepsy and
 include obesity, bruxism, enuresis, precocious puberty (among individuals with pediatric-onset
 narcolepsy), mood disorders, and ADHD. Rapid weight gain is common in young children with a
 sudden disease onset. Parasomnias (e.g., sleepwalking, REM sleep behavior disorder),
 obstructive sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome, and periodic limb movements are common in
 individuals who develop narcolepsy. Comorbid sleep apnea should be considered if there is a
 sudden aggravation of preexisting narcolepsy.
