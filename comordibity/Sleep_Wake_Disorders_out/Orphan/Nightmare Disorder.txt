Comorbidity
 Nightmares may be comorbid with several medical conditions, including coronary heart disease,
 cancer, parkinsonism, and pain, and can accompany medical treatments, such as hemodialysis, or
 withdrawal from medications or substances of abuse. Nightmares frequently co-occur with other
 mental disorders, including PTSD, acute stress disorder, insomnia disorder, REM sleep behavior
 disorder, and psychotic, mood, anxiety, adjustment, and personality disorders, as well as with
 grief during bereavement. A concurrent nightmare disorder diagnosis should only be considered
 when independent clinical attention is warranted. These conditions should be listed with the
 appropriate comorbid category specifier (e.g., “with REM sleep behavior disorder”); see also
 “Recording Procedures.”
