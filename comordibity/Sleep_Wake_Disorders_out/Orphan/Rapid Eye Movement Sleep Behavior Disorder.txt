 Comorbidity
 REM sleep behavior disorder is present concurrently in approximately 30% of patients with
 narcolepsy. When it occurs in narcolepsy, the demographics reflect the younger age range of
 narcolepsy, with equal frequency in men and women. Based on findings from individuals
 presenting to sleep clinics, most individuals (>70%) with initially “idiopathic” REM sleep
 behavior disorder will eventually develop a neurodegenerative disease—most notably, one of the
G25.81
 synucleinopathies (Parkinson’s disease, multiple system atrophy, or major or mild
 neurocognitive disorder with Lewy bodies). REM sleep behavior disorder often predates any
 other sign of these disorders by many years (often more than a decade).
