Comorbidity
 Insomnia is a common comorbidity of many medical conditions, including but not limited to
 cancer, diabetes, coronary heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, arthritis,
 fibromyalgia, other chronic pain conditions, degenerative brain diseases, and traumatic brain
 injury. The risk relationship appears to be bidirectional: insomnia increases the risk of many of
 these medical conditions, and medical problems increase the risk of insomnia. The direction of
 the relationship is not always clear and may change over time; for this reason, comorbid
 insomnia is the preferred terminology when insomnia coexists with another medical condition
 (or mental disorder). Insomnia disorder also coexists with numerous other sleep disorders.
 Approximately one in seven individuals with insomnia disorder has moderate to severe
 obstructive sleep apnea. Rates of insomnia complaints among individuals with narcolepsy are
 estimated to be about 50%.
