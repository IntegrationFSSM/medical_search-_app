 Comorbidity
 RLS is associated with higher rates of depression, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder,
 and posttraumatic stress disorder. The main medical condition comorbid with RLS is
cardiovascular disease. There may be an association with numerous other medical conditions,
 including hypertension, migraine, Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis, peripheral neuropathy,
 diabetes mellitus, fibromyalgia, osteoporosis, obesity, thyroid disease, and cancer, as well as
 other sleep disorders including narcolepsy and obstructive sleep apnea. RLS is common in those
 with iron deficiency, pregnancy, and chronic renal failure and can dramatically improve once
 these conditions resolve.
