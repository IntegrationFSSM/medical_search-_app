Comorbidity
 Many individuals with hypersomnolence disorder have symptoms of depression that may meet
 criteria for a depressive disorder. This presentation may be related to the psychosocial
 consequences of persistent increased sleep need. More than half of individuals with
 hypersomnolence disorder have attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptoms. Individuals
 with hypersomnolence disorder are also at risk for substance-related disorders, particularly
 related to self-medication with stimulants. This general lack of specificity may contribute to very
 heterogeneous profiles among individuals whose symptoms meet the diagnostic criteria for
 hypersomnolence disorder. Neurodegenerative conditions, such as Alzheimer’s disease,
 Parkinson’s disease, and multiple system atrophy, may also be associated with hypersomnolence.
