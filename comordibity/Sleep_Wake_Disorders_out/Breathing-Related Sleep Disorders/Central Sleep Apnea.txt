 Comorbidity
 Central sleep apnea disorders are frequently present in users of long-acting opioids, such as
 methadone. Individuals taking these medications have a breathing-related sleep disorder that
 could contribute to sleep disturbances and symptoms such as sleepiness,

 confusion, and depression. While the individual is asleep, breathing patterns such as central
apneas, periodic apneas, and ataxic breathing may be observed. Obstructive sleep apnea
 hypopnea may coexist with central sleep apnea, and features consistent with this condition can
 also be present (see “Obstructive Sleep Apnea Hypopnea” earlier in this chapter). Cheyne-Stokes
 breathing is more commonly observed in association with conditions that include heart failure,
 stroke, and renal failure and is seen more frequently in individuals with atrial fibrillation.
 Individuals with Cheyne-Stokes breathing are more likely to be older, to be male, and to have
 lower weight than individuals with obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea.
