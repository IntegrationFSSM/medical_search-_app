Comorbidity
 Delayed sleep phase type is associated with depressive disorders, personality disorders, somatic
 symptom disorder or illness anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, attention
deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and autism spectrum disorder. In addition, comorbid sleep
 disorders, such as insomnia disorder, restless legs syndrome, and sleep apnea, as

 well as depressive and bipolar disorders and anxiety disorders, can exacerbate symptoms of
 insomnia and excessive sleepiness. Delayed sleep phase type may overlap with another circadian
 rhythm sleep-wake disorder, non-24-hour sleep-wake type. Sighted individuals with non-24-hour
 sleep-wake type disorder commonly also have a history of delayed circadian sleep phase.
