 Comorbidity
 Sleep-related hypoventilation often occurs in association with a pulmonary disorder (e.g.,
 interstitial lung disease, COPD), with a neuromuscular or chest wall disorder (e.g., muscular
 dystrophies, post-polio syndrome, cervical spinal cord injury, kyphoscoliosis), with obesity, or,
 most relevant to the clinician, with medication use (e.g., benzodiazepines, opiates). Congenital
 central alveolar hypoventilation often occurs in association with autonomic dysfunction and may
 occur in association with Hirschsprung’s disease. COPD, a disorder of lower airway obstruction
 usually associated with cigarette smoking, can result in sleep-related hypoventilation and
 hypoxemia. The presence of coexisting obstructive sleep apnea

 hypopnea is thought to exacerbate hypoxemia and hypercapnia during sleep and wakefulness.
 The relationship between congenital central alveolar hypoventilation and idiopathic sleep-related
 hypoventilation is unclear; in some individuals, idiopathic sleep-related hypoventilation may
 represent cases of late-onset congenital central alveolar hypoventilation.
