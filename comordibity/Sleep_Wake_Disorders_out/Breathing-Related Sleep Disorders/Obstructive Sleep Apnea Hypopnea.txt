 Comorbidity
Systemic hypertension, coronary artery disease, heart failure, stroke, diabetes, and increased
 mortality are consistently associated with obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea. Risk
 435
 estimates vary from 30% to as much as 300% for moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea
 hypopnea. Obstructive sleep apnea and cardiovascular disease are strongly related, and treatment
 of obstructive sleep apnea reduces morbidity and mortality of cardiovascular disease. Ethnic and
 racialized groups that have not received adequate health care may be at higher risk for undetected
 cardiovascular risk factors associated with obstructive sleep apnea. Evidence of pulmonary
 hypertension and right heart failure (e.g., cor pulmonale, ankle edema, hepatic congestion) is rare
 in obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea and when present indicates either very severe disease or
 associated hypoventilation or cardiopulmonary comorbidities. Obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea
 also may occur with increased frequency in association with a number of medical or neurological
 conditions (e.g., cerebrovascular disease, Parkinson’s disease). Physical findings reflect the co
occurrence of these conditions.
 As many as one-third of individuals referred for evaluation of obstructive sleep apnea
 hypopnea report symptoms of depression, with as many of 10% having depression scores
 consistent with moderate to severe depression. Severity of obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea, as
 measured by the apnea hypopnea index, has been found to be correlated with severity of
 symptoms of depression. This association may be stronger in men than in women.
