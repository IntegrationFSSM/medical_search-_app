Comorbidity
 Histrionic personality disorder has been associated with higher rates of borderline, narcissistic,
 paranoid, dependent, and antisocial personality disorders; alcohol and other substance use and
 misuse; as well as aggression and violence. Histrionic personality disorder is also thought to be
 related to somatic symptom disorder, functional neurological symptom disorder (conversion
 disorder), and major depressive disorder.
