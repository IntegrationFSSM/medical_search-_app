 Comorbidity
 Individuals with antisocial personality disorder may also experience dysphoria, including
 complaints of tension, inability to tolerate boredom, and depressed mood. They may have
 associated anxiety disorders, mood disorders, substance use disorders, somatic symptom
 disorder, and gambling disorder. Individuals with antisocial personality disorder also often have
 personality features that meet criteria for other personality disorders, particularly borderline,
 histrionic, and narcissistic personality disorders. The likelihood of developing antisocial
 personality disorder in adult life is increased if the individual experienced childhood onset of
 conduct disorder (before age 10 years) and accompanying attention-deficit/hyperactivity
 disorder.
