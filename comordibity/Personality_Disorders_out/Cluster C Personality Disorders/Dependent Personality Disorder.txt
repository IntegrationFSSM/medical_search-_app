Comorbidity
 There may be an increased risk of depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, and adjustment
 disorders. Dependent personality disorder often co-occurs with other personality disorders,
 especially borderline, avoidant, and histrionic personality disorders. Chronic physical illness or
 persistent separation anxiety disorder in childhood or adolescence may predispose the individual
 to the development of this disorder.
