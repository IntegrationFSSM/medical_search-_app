Comorbidity
 Individuals with anxiety disorders (e.g., generalized anxiety disorder, separation anxiety
 disorder, social anxiety disorder, specific phobias) and OCD have an increased likelihood of
 having a personality disturbance that meets criteria for obsessive-compulsive personality
 disorder. Even so, it appears that the majority of individuals with OCD do not have a pattern of
 behavior that meets criteria for this personality disorder. Many of the features of obsessive
compulsive personality disorder overlap with “type A” personality characteristics (e.g.,
 preoccupation with work, competitiveness, time urgency), and these features may be present in
 individuals at risk for myocardial infarction. There may be an association between obsessive
compulsive personality disorder and depressive and bipolar disorders and eating disorders.
