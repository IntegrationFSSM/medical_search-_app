 Comorbidity
 Particularly in response to stress, individuals with this disorder may experience very brief
 psychotic episodes (lasting minutes to hours). In some instances, schizoid personality disorder
 may appear as the premorbid antecedent of delusional disorder or schizophrenia. Individuals
 with this disorder may sometimes develop major depressive disorder. Schizoid personality
 disorder most often co-occurs with schizotypal, paranoid, and avoidant personality disorders.
