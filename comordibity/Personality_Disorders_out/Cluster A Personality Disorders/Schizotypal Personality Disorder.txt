 Comorbidity
 Particularly in response to stress, individuals with this disorder may experience transient
 psychotic episodes (lasting minutes to hours), although they usually are insufficient in duration
 to warrant an additional diagnosis such as brief psychotic disorder or schizophreniform disorder.
 In some cases, clinically significant psychotic symptoms may develop that meet criteria for brief
 psychotic disorder, schizophreniform disorder, delusional disorder, or schizophrenia. There is
 considerable co-occurrence with schizoid, paranoid, avoidant, and borderline personality
 disorders.
