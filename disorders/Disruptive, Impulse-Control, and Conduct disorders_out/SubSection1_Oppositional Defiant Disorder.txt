Oppositional Defiant Disorder
 Diagnostic Criteria
 A. A pattern of angry/irritable mood, argumentative/defiant behavior, or
 vindictiveness lasting at least 6 months as evidenced by at least four symptoms
 from any of the following categories, and exhibited during interaction with at least
 one individual who is not a sibling.
 Angry/Irritable Mood
 1. Often loses temper.
 2. Is often touchy or easily annoyed.
 3. Is often angry and resentful.
 Argumentative/Defiant Behavior
 4. Often argues with authority figures or, for children and adolescents, with
 adults.
 5. Often actively defies or refuses to comply with requests from authority figures
 or with rules.
 6. Often deliberately annoys others.
 7. Often blames others for his or her mistakes or misbehavior.
Vindictiveness
 8. Has been spiteful or vindictive at least twice within the past 6 months.
 Note: The persistence and frequency of these behaviors should be used to
 distinguish a behavior that is within normal limits from a behavior that is
 symptomatic. For children younger than 5 years, the behavior should occur on
 most days for a period of at least 6 months unless otherwise noted (Criterion
 A8). For individuals 5 years or older, the behavior should occur at least once
 per week for at least 6 months, unless otherwise noted (Criterion A8). While
 these frequency criteria provide guidance on a minimal level of frequency to
 define symptoms, other factors should also be considered, such as whether the
 frequency and intensity of the behaviors are outside a range that is normative
 for the individual’s developmental level, gender, and culture.
 B. The disturbance in behavior is associated with distress in the individual or others
 in his or her immediate social context (e.g., family, peer group, work colleagues),
 or it impacts negatively on social, educational, occupational, or other important
 areas of functioning.
 523
 C. The behaviors do not occur exclusively during the course of a psychotic,
 substance use, depressive, or bipolar disorder. Also, the criteria are not met for
 disruptive mood dysregulation disorder.
 Specify current severity:
 Mild: Symptoms are confined to only one setting (e.g., at home, at school, at
 work, with peers).
 Moderate: Some symptoms are present in at least two settings.
 Severe: Some symptoms are present in three or more settings.
 Specifiers
 It is not uncommon for individuals with oppositional defiant disorder to show symptoms only at
 home and only with family members. However, the pervasiveness of the symptoms is an
 indicator of the severity of the disorder.
 Diagnostic Features
 The essential feature of oppositional defiant disorder is a frequent and persistent pattern of
 angry/irritable mood, argumentative/defiant behavior, or vindictiveness (Criterion A). It is not
 unusual for individuals with oppositional defiant disorder to show the behavioral features of the
 disorder without problems of negative mood. However, individuals with the disorder who show
 the angry/irritable mood symptoms typically show the behavioral features as well.
 The symptoms of oppositional defiant disorder may be confined to only one setting, and this
 is most frequently the home. Individuals who show enough symptoms to meet the diagnostic
 threshold, even if it is only at home, may be significantly impaired in their social functioning.
However, in more severe cases, the symptoms of the disorder are present in multiple settings.
 Given that the pervasiveness of symptoms is an indicator of the severity of the disorder, it is
 critical that the individual’s behavior be assessed across multiple settings and relationships.
 Because these behaviors are common among siblings, they must be observed during interactions
 with persons other than siblings. Also, because symptoms of the disorder are typically more
 evident in interactions with adults or peers whom the individual knows well, they may not be
 apparent during a clinical examination.
 The symptoms of oppositional defiant disorder can occur to some degree in persons without
 this disorder. There are several key considerations for determining if the behaviors are
 symptomatic of oppositional defiant disorder. First, the diagnostic threshold of four or more
 symptoms within the preceding 6 months must be met. Second, the persistence and frequency of
 the symptoms should exceed what is normative for an individual’s age, gender, and culture.
 Temper outbursts for a preschool child would be considered a symptom of oppositional defiant
 disorder only if they occurred on most days for the preceding 6 months, if they occurred with at
 least three other symptoms of the disorder, and if the temper outbursts contributed to the
 significant impairment associated with the disorder (e.g., led to destruction of property during
 outbursts, resulted in the child being asked to leave a preschool). It should be noted that temper
 loss need not always involve tantrum behavior and can be displayed by angry facial expressions,
 verbal expressions of anger, and subjective feelings of anger that would not typically be
 considered a tantrum.
 The symptoms of the disorder often are part of a pattern of problematic interactions with
 others. Furthermore, individuals with this disorder typically do not regard themselves as angry,
 oppositional, or defiant. Instead, they often justify their behavior as a response to unreasonable
 demands or circumstances. Thus, it can be difficult to disentangle the relative contribution of the
 individual with the disorder to the problematic interactions he or she experiences. For example,
 children with oppositional defiant disorder may have
 524
 experienced a history of hostile parenting, and it is often impossible to determine if the
 child’s behavior caused the parents to act in a more hostile manner toward the child, if the
 parents’ hostility led to the child’s problematic behavior, or if there was some combination of
 both. Whether or not the clinician can separate the relative contributions of potential causal
 factors should not influence whether the diagnosis is made. In the event that the child may be
 living in particularly poor conditions where neglect or mistreatment may occur (e.g., in
 institutional settings), clinical attention to reducing the contribution of the environment may be
 helpful.
 Associated Features
 Two of the most common co-occurring conditions with oppositional defiant disorder are
 attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and conduct disorder (see the section
 “Comorbidity” for this disorder). Oppositional defiant disorder has been associated with
 increased risk for suicide attempts, even after comorbid disorders are controlled for.
Prevalence
 The cross-national prevalence of oppositional defiant disorder ranges from 1% to 11%, with an
 average prevalence estimate of around 3.3%. The rate of oppositional defiant disorder may vary
 depending on the age and gender of the child. The disorder appears to be somewhat more
 prevalent in boys than in girls (1.59:1) prior to adolescence. This male predominance is not
 consistently found in samples of adolescents or adults.
 Development and Course
 The first symptoms of oppositional defiant disorder usually appear during the preschool years
 and rarely later than early adolescence. Oppositional defiant disorder often precedes the
 development of conduct disorder, especially for those with the childhood-onset type of conduct
 disorder. However, many children and adolescents with oppositional defiant disorder do not
 subsequently develop conduct disorder. Oppositional defiant disorder also conveys risk for the
 development of anxiety disorders and major depressive disorder, even in the absence of conduct
 disorder. The defiant, argumentative, and vindictive symptoms carry most of the risk for conduct
 disorder, whereas the angry/irritable mood symptoms carry most of the risk for mood and
 anxiety disorders.
 Manifestations of the disorder across development appear consistent. Children and
 adolescents with oppositional defiant disorder are at increased risk for a number of problems in
 adjustment as adults, including functional impairments (e.g., problems in relationships with
 family, peers, and romantic partners; lower educational attainment; more workplace stress), the
 persistence of oppositional defiant disorder, and other psychopathology, such as antisocial
 behavior, impulse-control problems, substance misuse, anxiety, and depression.
 Many of the behaviors associated with oppositional defiant disorder increase in frequency
 during the preschool period and in adolescence. Thus, it is especially critical during these
 development periods that the frequency and intensity of these behaviors be evaluated against
 normative levels before it is decided that they are symptoms of oppositional defiant disorder. For
 example, it is not unusual for preschool children to show temper tantrums on a weekly basis, but
 daily tantrums occur in only about 10% of preschool children.
 Risk and Prognostic Factors
 Temperamental.
 Temperamental factors related to problems in emotional regulation (e.g., high
 levels of emotional reactivity, poor frustration tolerance) have been predictive of the disorder.
 525
 Environmental.
 Children with oppositional defiant disorder influence their environments, which
 in turn can influence them. For example, harsh, inconsistent, or neglectful child-rearing practices
 predict increases in symptoms, and oppositional symptoms predict increases in harsh and
 inconsistent parenting. In children and adolescents, oppositional defiant disorder is more
 prevalent in families in which childcare is disrupted by a succession of different caregivers.
 Children with oppositional defiant disorder are also at greater risk for both bullying peers and
 being bullied by peers.
Genetic and physiological.
 A number of neurobiological markers (e.g., lower heart rate and skin
 conductance reactivity; reduced basal cortisol reactivity; abnormalities in the prefrontal cortex
 and amygdala) have been associated with oppositional defiant disorder. Studies have
 demonstrated overlapping genetic influences for the irritability and anger symptoms of
 oppositional defiant disorder with depression and generalized anxiety disorder. To date, the vast
 majority of studies have not separated children with oppositional defiant disorder from those
 with conduct disorder. Further study of markers specific to oppositional defiant disorder is
 needed.
 Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues
 The reported prevalence of oppositional defiant disorder or other disruptive disorders may be
 affected by misdiagnosis or overdiagnosis of individuals from some cultural backgrounds. Social
 norms may affect the prevalence of the disorder and its male gender predominance in children
 and adolescents. A meta-analysis of prevalence rates in middle childhood found that the disorder
 is more common in boys compared with girls in Western cultures, but that the prevalence is
 similar across genders in non-Western cultures. Also, despite adverse experiences, first
generation migrants and refugees may be at decreased risk of developing oppositional defiant
 disorder symptoms.
 Sex- and Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues
 Some studies find few sex or gender differences for this disorder compared with, for example,
 conduct disorder. There may be slight differences in risk factors with harsh parenting more
 highly associated with oppositional defiant disorder in girls but not boys.
 Functional Consequences of Oppositional Defiant Disorder
 When oppositional defiant disorder is persistent throughout development, individuals with the
 disorder experience frequent conflicts with parents, teachers, supervisors, peers, and romantic
 partners. Such problems often result in significant impairments in the individual’s emotional,
 social, academic, and occupational adjustment.
 Differential Diagnosis
 Conduct disorder.
 Conduct disorder and oppositional defiant disorder are both related to conduct
 problems that bring the individual in conflict with adults and other authority figures (e.g.,
 teachers, work supervisors). The behaviors of oppositional defiant disorder are typically of a less
 severe nature than those of conduct disorder and do not include aggression toward people or
 animals, destruction of property, or a pattern of theft or deceit. However, evidence suggests that
 oppositional defiant disorder is associated with equivalent or even greater levels of impairment
 than conduct disorder. Furthermore, oppositional defiant disorder includes problems of emotion
 dysregulation (i.e., angry and irritable mood) that are not included in the definition of conduct
 disorder.
 Adjustment disorder.
 Environmental and family stressors may be associated with externalizing
 manifestations of emotion dysregulation. In children, these may manifest as
526
 tantrums and oppositional behavior; and in adolescents, as aggressive behaviors (e.g., rebellion
 and defiance). Temporal association with a stressor and symptom duration of less than 6 months
 after the resolution of the stressor may help distinguish adjustment disorder from oppositional
 defiant disorder.
 Posttraumatic stress disorder.
 In children younger than 6 years, posttraumatic stress disorder may
 manifest initially as dysregulated behaviors, opposition, and tantrums; the association with a
 traumatic event and with other specific symptoms (traumatic play) are key to establishing the
 diagnosis. In adolescents, traumatic reenactment and risk-taking may be misinterpreted as
 defiance and opposition or as conduct problems.
 Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.
 ADHD is often comorbid with oppositional defiant disorder.
 To make the additional diagnosis of oppositional defiant disorder, it is important to determine
 that the individual’s failure to conform to requests of others is not solely in situations that
 demand sustained effort and attention or demand that the individual sit still.
 Depressive and bipolar disorders.
 Depressive and bipolar disorders often involve negative affect
 and irritability. As a result, a diagnosis of oppositional defiant disorder should not be made if the
 symptoms occur exclusively during the course of a mood disorder.
 Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder.
 Oppositional defiant disorder shares with disruptive mood
 dysregulation disorder the symptoms of chronic irritable mood and temper outbursts. However, if
 the irritable mood and other symptoms meet criteria for disruptive mood dysregulation disorder,
 a diagnosis of oppositional defiant disorder is not given, even if all criteria for oppositional
 defiant disorder are met.
 Intermittent explosive disorder.
 Intermittent explosive disorder also involves high rates of anger.
 However, individuals with this disorder show serious aggression toward others that is not part of
 the definition of oppositional defiant disorder.
 Intellectual developmental disorder (intellectual disability).
 In 
individuals 
with 
intellectual
 developmental disorder, a diagnosis of oppositional defiant disorder is given only if the
 oppositional behavior is markedly greater than is commonly observed among individuals of
 comparable mental age and with comparable severity of intellectual disability.
 Language disorder.
 Social anxiety disorder.
 Oppositional defiant disorder must also be distinguished from a failure to
 follow directions that is the result of impaired language comprehension (e.g., hearing loss).
 Oppositional defiant disorder must also be distinguished from defiance
 because of fear of negative evaluation associated with social anxiety disorder.
 Comorbidity
 Rates of oppositional defiant disorder are much higher in samples of children, adolescents, and
 adults with ADHD, and this may be the result of shared temperamental risk factors. Also,
 oppositional defiant disorder often precedes conduct disorder, although this appears to be most
 common in children with the childhood-onset subtype. Individuals with oppositional defiant
 disorder are also at increased risk for anxiety disorders and major depressive disorder, and this
 seems largely attributable to the presence of the angry-irritable mood symptoms. Extremely high
F63.81
 rates of comorbidity between disruptive mood dysregulation disorder and symptoms
 characteristic of oppositional defiant disorder have been reported, with most individuals with
 disruptive mood dysregulation disorder having symptoms that meet criteria for oppositional
 defiant disorder (such as showing argumentative/defiant symptoms); but because oppositional
 defiant disorder cannot be diagnosed if criteria are also met for disruptive mood dysregulation
 disorder, only disruptive mood dysregulation disorder would be diagnosed in such cases.
 Adolescents and adults with oppositional defiant disorder also show a higher rate of substance
 use disorders,
 527
 although it is unclear if this association is independent of the comorbidity with conduct disorder.
